FRTUT1;Illithids, or mind flayers, have their own special mechanics that affect how they play significantly. These mechanics are ceremorphosis and mind control. Which would you like to learn about?;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRTUT1.a;Learn about Ceremorphosis?;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRTUT1.b;Learn about Mind Control;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRTUT1.c;Close tutorial;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRTUT2;Ceremorphosis is a targeted decision that allows you to create a new heir from a prisoner. The prisoner must be a humanoid (like humans, half-humans, elves, orcs or goblinoids). This decision has a chance of failure and costs piety (scaling with how many heirs you have).\n Rarely, a newly created illithid can turn out to be a ulitharid, an exceptionally powerful and longlived illithid variant.;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRTUT3;Mind control is a decision that can target any of your vassals or courtiers as long as they are not illithids or yikarians. It costs both piety and prestige, but makes the target utterly loyal to you for 10 years.;;;;;;;;;;;x
WIZTUTORIAL;Wizards (and other spellcasters like sorcerers and clerics) have unique mechanics that you may want to know about. These mechanics control how they cast and acquire their spells. What would you like to learn about?;;;;;;;;;;;x
WIZTUTORIAL.a;Wizardly Schools of Magic;;;;;;;;;;;x
WIZTUTORIAL.2;Picking a school of magic will add a trait to your character. Some school traits will only bestow simple, straightforward bonuses, visible on the trait: for example, the Evocation school trait will increase your combat damage.\n Other schools have no visible effects, but they all do something: for example, the Necromancy school increase the number of undead summoned in a single ritual, and grants access to an exclusive ritual that turns prisoners into undead servants.;;;;;;;;;;;x
WIZTUTORIAL.b;Performing Rituals;;;;;;;;;;;x
WIZTUTORIAL.3;Performing rituals costs gold, while combat magic is performed freely and automatically (through combat tactics) during battles. Powerful spellcasters require less gold expenditure for rituals than weak spellcasters. Some rituals are also more effective when performed by high level spellcasters (an example: summoning spells).\n Sorcerers aren't ritualists, and must expend a different resource to cast magic: Spell Points. Spell Points are displayed in a modifier on your character. Sorcerer Spell Points are determined based on your diplomacy and sorcerer level. These refresh once a year.;;;;;;;;;;;x
WIZTUTORIAL.c;Sorcerer Origins;;;;;;;;;;;x
WIZTUTORIAL.4;The path of sorcery is not for everybody. Sorcerers are arcane spellcasters whose magic comes not from discipline or pacts with otherworldly entites, but from themselves. This is usually due to being descended from some highly-magical creature such as a dragon. A character can become a sorcerer only if a Sorcerer Origin trait has manifested during childhood or puberty.;;;;;;;;;;;x
WIZTUTORIAL.d;Laws on Arcane Magic;;;;;;;;;;;x
WIZTUTORIAL.5;Some realms and religions have a dim view on arcane magic and may seek to regulate or even outlaw its use. In realms where it is outlawed, arcane casters can even be imprisoned by the local rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
WIZTUTORIAL.e;Warlock Pacts;;;;;;;;;;;x
RULE_TUTORIALS;§RFaerun:§! Tutorials;;;;;;;;;;;x
WIZTUTORIAL.6;Every warlock needs to pick a patron. The nature of their patron determines what kind of rituals the warlock gets (for example, the celestial patron is focused on healing rituals). A trained warlock can manifest a Pact Boon, an artifact that can take many different forms: a weapon (bonus martial and combat skill), a familiar (bonus combat skill and other bonus depending on the familiar type), or a book of rituals (bonus learning and access to a few rituals that wouldn't normally be available to warlocks).;;;;;;;;;;;x

MOANDERSTORYT.1;The Abomination;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOANDERSTORYD.1;Terror and confusion grip Yûlash as a horrible monstrosity of filth has arisen from underneath the very streets. It spends some time rampaging and wreaking havoc across the city before veering off to the south, towards Cormanthor.\n\nIn the aftermath, many are left dead, and those who survive are sickened with some strange affliction. Those sages who managed to remain unscathed claim that the abomination was an avatar of the ancient god Moander.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOANDERSTORYO.1;What did we do to deserve this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
moanders_road;Moander's Road;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOANDERSTORYD.2;A horrible monster, an abomination, has come from the north, from the direction of Yûlash. It is a massive horror of rot, filth and root. It devours all in its path, growing larger in the process, as it makes its way to the south, to Myth Drannor.\n\nOnce it is gone you inquire with the local sages, and some suggest it was nothing less than the avatar of Moander themself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOANDERSTORYO.2;What could it seek in Myth Drannor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOANDERSTORYD.3;Your scouts warned you of its coming, but it was still hard to believe. The avatar of Moander, long since thought dead, marched on Myth Drannor. There, they defiled all they touched, enacting revenge for their imprisonment under Yûlash.\n\nAfter what seems an eternity, they opened a Gate and stepped through to places unknown. Those present swear they saw figues chasing them, including a dragon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOANDERSTORYO.3;Who would chase such a monster?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOANDERSTORYD.4;In the middle of a seemingly-normal day in Westgate, a magical Gate was torn open in the skies above the city. From it came forth what can only be called an abomination, a titanic monster of rot and corruption that has now been identified as the avatar of a god: Moander.\n\nA second surprise followed the god - a great red dragon soon emerged from the gate and it and the god did battle in the skies. Despite all odds, the wyrm managed to incinerate and kill the avatar, though at the cost of its own life.\n\nNone know why the god came to Westgate or why the dragon chased and gave battle, but all the city now breathes a sigh of relief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOANDERSTORYO.4;Is it over?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOANDERSTORYD.5;Stories coming from the city of Yûlash relate a tale of horror: a great monster of filth and corruption burst forth from beneath the city streets and rampaged across the settlement before finally heading southwards, into Cormanthor.\n\nIn its wake, sages are suggesting it was nothing else than the avatar of the ancient god Moander.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOANDERSTORYO.5a;What?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOANDERSTORYO.5b;Praise be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOANDERSTORYD.6;Tales of destruction come from the region of Greentree, and the trail of destruction and corruption left there attest to their veracity: a might creature, an avatar of Moander, made their way across the region heading south and devouring all in their path. What they seek is unknown, but Myth Drannor lies next along their path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOANDERSTORYO.6a;Why Myth Drannor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOANDERSTORYO.6b;None shall stop Moander!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOANDERSTORYD.7;Though those who dwell in Myth Drannor had plenty of warning, it was still impossible for them to stop the godly avatar of Moander as they made their way to the capital of those who once imprisoned the foul deity.\n\nDespite their captors being long-dead, Moander still wreaked havoc in the area before finally opening a Gate and stepping through to parts unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOANDERSTORYO.7a;Where did they go?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOANDERSTORYO.7b;Vengeance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MOANDERSTORYD.8;Stories are flooding in from Westgate and they are hard to believe. According to them, a magical Gate was torn open in the skies above the city and from it came forth the avatar of the god Moander. As if that wasn't fantastical enough, a massive red dragon soon followed through the Gate and battled the foul god. Despite all odds, the wyrm managed to incinerate and kill the avatar, though at the cost of its own life.\n\nMany are unsure if they can believe such a tale, or if it is some kind of portent of things to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

UTHTUT.1a;Beast Totems;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
UTHTUT.2;Uthgar is worshipped through beast totems, who must be selected like a patron deity, although they do not grant any bonuses. This selection affects other Uthgardt mechanics in a number of ways:\nYou can emulate your Beast Totem for a temporary modifier.\nHolding an Uthgardt tribal title that doesn't match your Beast Totem will grant penalities until you get rid of it.\nIf the tribal title tied to your Totem is destroyed, you can restore it.\nIf the Ancestral Mound associated with your Totem is not in Uthgardt hands, you will gain a CB to reclaim it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
UTHTUT.1b;Tribal Restoration;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
UTHTUT.3;If a ruler who holds an Uthgardt tribal title is not of the Uthgardt religion, then any ruler of the Uthgardt religion may utilize the Tribal Restoration CB against them. If victorious, you will gain the title if you have the appropriate Beast Totem trait, or it will go to a new character who will immediately become your ally or vassal, depending on your rank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
UTHTUT.1c;Religious Festivals;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
UTHTUT.4;Uthgardt religion rulers may take part in the yearly festival of the Runemeet and take part in the religious celebrations of Uthgar's holy day.\nAdditionally, they can also throw special, but minor, religious feasts during the solstices and spring equinox. This second decision requires The Old Gods as it utilizes content from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
UTHTUT.5a;Miscellaneous Features;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
UTHTUT.6;Uthgardt religion characters may not pick any arcane class, and any arcane characters who convert will get a negative modifier.\n\nWhen a close relative dies, characters may choose to bury their kin at the Ancestral Mound.\n\nIn defensive wars, decisions become available to both summon undead troops, or an undead commander.\n\nGreat quantities of piety can be spent to summon a fragment of your Beast Totem into your body for a period of time, giving you the Avatar trait for the duration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRTUT.23.a;Illuskan Cultural Mechanics;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ILLUSTUT.1;Characters from the Illuskan culture group have access to the following:\nA Court Skald minor title that will grant them prestige if assigned\nCan always raid overseas\nCan raise Runestones\n\nIlluskan and Northlander cultures also have access to a form of non-lethal duels against characters they dislike of those two cultures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
