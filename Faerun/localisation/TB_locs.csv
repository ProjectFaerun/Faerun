FRTUT1;Illithids, or mind flayers, have their own special mechanics that affect how they play significantly. These mechanics are ceremorphosis and mind control. Which would you like to learn about?;;;;;;;;;;;x

FRTUT1.b;Learn about Mind Control;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRTUT1.c;Close tutorial;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRTUT2;Ceremorphosis is a targeted decision that allows you to create a new heir from a prisoner. The prisoner must be a human, half-human, elf, orc or goblinoid of less than 70 years of age (unless they are an elf or gith). This has a chance of failure and costs piety (scaling with how many heirs you have).;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRTUT3;Mind control is a decision that can target any of your vassals or courtiers as long as they are not illithids or yikarians. It costs both piety and prestige, but makes the target utterly loyal to you for 10 years.;;;;;;;;;;;x
WIZTUTORIAL;Wizards have unique mechanics that you may want to know about. These mechanics control how they cast and acquire their spells. What would you like to learn about?;;;;;;;;;;;x
WIZTUTORIAL.a;Schools of Magic.;;;;;;;;;;;x
WIZTUTORIAL.2;In order to access spells other than the universal ones you must choose a school of magic to specialize in. Each, except Wild Magic, has opposed schools whose spells you can't learn and will give you a set of spells of that school. Wild Magic will instead grant you a single unique spell plus a few spells from other schools.;;;;;;;;;;;x
WIZTUTORIAL.b;Casting spells.;;;;;;;;;;;x
WIZTUTORIAL.3;To cast a spell, you must expend spell points, which are displayed in a modifier on your character. Spell points are determined based on your learning and wizard level. These refresh, and are recalculated, once a year.;;;;;;;;;;;x
WIZTUTORIAL.c;Researching spells.;;;;;;;;;;;x
WIZTUTORIAL.4;In order to get new spells, you must research them via a decision that costs gold (scaled on your income). You are guaranteed to learn one new spell, though the time it takes may vary. You can't learn spells from opposing schools.;;;;;;;;;;;x
WIZTUTORIAL.d;Laws on Arcane Magic;;;;;;;;;;;x
WIZTUTORIAL.5;Some realms and religions have a dim view on arcane magic and may seek to regulate or even outlaw its use. In realms where it is outlawed, arcane casters can even be imprisoned by the local rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
