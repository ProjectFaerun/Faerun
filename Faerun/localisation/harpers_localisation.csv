#how to support people
EVTDESC_HRP_101;If I want to improve my subjects' condition, lowering the taxes they owe me is the simple, straightforward choice. I wonder if I could come up with a different solution...;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HRP_101;Simple solutions are often the best.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_HRP_202;I want to employ them for a longer time.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HRP_1003;Greetings, [Root.GetTitledFirstName].\n [elimination_target.GetFirstName] is suspected to be a member of the [elimination_target.Society.GetName], operating from within your own lands. We would like to have this hostile interloper eliminated or neutralized, as you see fit.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_LA_507_HRP;With [From.GetFirstName] out of the way, your enemies' capability to interfere with your internal affairs is greatly reduced. You've shown those wicked villains what the Harpers are capable of.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LA_507_HRP;Our enemies are many, but we'll never give up.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
HRP_desc.1;The Harpers have been very supportive of your planned war, but things have changed, and you can no longer call yourself an harper nowadays. While your target remains a tyrant, deserving of being overthrown, you are no longer deemed fit to lead this battle.\n The momentum of the invasion has been irrevocably lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
HRP_desc.2;After getting everyone's hopes up, you failed to wage war in 2 years. Clearly, no tyrant will be deposed anytime soon, and all the adventurers and freedom fighters that joined your side are now leaving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HRP_desc.2a;All For Naught;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
HRP_desc.4;Violating the oath made to the Harpers,[From.GetTitledName] has decided to wage a personal, unsanctioned war. While the outcome of the war has yet to be decided, the adventurers and freedom fighters that gathered under [From.GetHerHis] banner have deserted in protest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HRP_desc_opt.4a;Ha! [From.GetHerHis] impatience got the best of [From.GetHerHis] common sense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
HRP_desc.6;Large numbers of freedom fighters have arrived from all corners of [prep_invader_target.GetTitledName]'s realm, hoping to join your fight against tyranny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HRP_desc.10;Thanks to my standing among the Harpers, I will wage war against the tyrant [From.prep_invader_target.GetTitledName], attracting freedom fighters, adventurers and other warriors to my banner.

#
HRP_desc.17b;Pre-emptive hostilities with [prep_invader_target.GetTitledName] has disrupted the flow of volunteers and arms into your staging grounds. Many of the soldiers, carried away by the atmosphere, have staged raids on their own and have lost contact with the main host. Some of the more prideful ones have dispersed, upset that their assent was not sought. Rumors are already spreading that the invasion has already begun, discouraging latecomers from turning up and infuriating many who feel like they were left behind by the main host.\n The momentum of the invasion has been irrevocably lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
HRP_desc.17c;The subordination of [prep_invader_target.GetTitledName] by [prep_invader_target.Liege.GetTitledName] has had unforeseen effects on the momentum of your invasion. Many of your volunteers aren't sure this war would be righteous, anymore. Many of them are sympathetic to [persistent_event_target:prep_invader_target.Liege.GetTitledName]'s cause and have left citing concerns of honour.\n The momentum of the invasion has been irrevocably lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
HRP_desc.17f;With the recent string of defeats suffered by [prep_invader_target.GetTitledName], their realm has weakened to the point of insignificance. Most of our harper-lead volunteers are now leaving, moving on to more pressing concerns.\n The momentum of the invasion has been irrevocably lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
