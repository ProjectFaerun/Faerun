VampGhul;Great Ghul;;;;;;;;;;;x
VampBeh;Bloodkiss Beholder;;;;;;;;;;;x

VampGhulDesc;Great Ghuls are the genie equivalent of vampires, and are automatically considered to be the lowest in the hierarchy of those outsiders. They are notable for having donkey hooves instead of feet, and in addition to the thirst for blood shared by all vampires, they also crave necrotic flesh.;;;;;;;;;;;x

origin_aberrant_mind;Aberrant Mind Sorcerous Origin;;;;;;;;;;;x
origin_aberrant_mind_desc;Shadowed eyes watching, whispers within this character's mind, and the echoes of mad gods trail in this character's wake. This character's mind and body has been touched by forces abominable, things unknowable, by forces uncaring. They could wield great power over the hearts and souls of mortals, their psyche a mere toy for this character's amusemortalst. Though they should beware, mortals who play the cruel cat may meet the hungry dog.;;;;;;;;;;;x
origin_draconic;Draconic Sorcerous Origin;;;;;;;;;;;x
origin_draconic_desc;Pride, elegance, and power, are but some description of all things Draconic. This character's powers come from the intermingling of Dragons and the weaker races. Whether it was the mutual trade of knowledge, or perhaps a story fit for a bawdy tavern, they bear the burden of magical might. Will they resist the temptation of tyranny, or embrace it? Will they be a paragon of justice? Or perhaps something else?;;;;;;;;;;;x
origin_divine_soul;Divine Soul Sorcerous Origin;;;;;;;;;;;x
origin_divine_soul_desc;Visions of Heaven fill this character's dreams. Songs of cherubs ring this character's ears. Forces beyond the realm of mortals have touched them, making them a vessel of Divine power. But is this truly this character's fate? Are they a pawn, in this great cosmic game, or does this character's destiny hold more? Churches and cults either fear or revere them, but who will they prove right in the very end?;;;;;;;;;;;x
origin_shadow;Shadow Sorcerous Origin;;;;;;;;;;;x
origin_shadow_desc;Ever since childhood, the darkness has been this character's home. Things morbid and grim seemed to surround them, but never did they fear its touch.

Where they walk, a cold spectre follows this character, as their touch fills others with the warmth of graves.;;;;;;;;;;;x
origin_storm;Storm Sorcerous Origin;;;;;;;;;;;x
origin_storm_desc;The caress of the wind was like a second mother for this character. The howling of gales and storms never daunted this character in their travels. They are a child of storms, wind and lightning answer this character's beck and call. The heavens themselves move with this character's power, and the air surrounding them is their shield. Perhaps the very elementalists themselves sired them, or perhaps a djinn touched this character's bloodline.;;;;;;;;;;;x
origin_wild_magic;Wild Magic Sorcerous Origin;;;;;;;;;;;x
origin_wild_magic_desc;Chaos is the only constant in this character's disorderly life. Magic has been with them since early childhood, with all the terror and joy it brings.
