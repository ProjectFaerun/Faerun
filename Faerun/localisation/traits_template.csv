VampBeh;Bloodkiss Beholder;;;;;;;;;;;x
VampDefDesc;A vampire is a former humanoid turned undead creature. They resemble their former, living selves with paler skin, haunting red eyes, and a feral cast to their features. They are drawn to the blood of the living.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VampGhulDesc;Great Ghuls are the genie equivalent of vampires, and are automatically considered to be the lowest in the hierarchy of those outsiders. They are notable for having donkey hooves instead of feet, and in addition to the thirst for blood shared by all vampires, they also crave necrotic flesh.;;;;;;;;;;;x

vampire_spawn_desc;[Root.VampSDesc];;;;;;;;;;;x
VampSDefDesc;Vampire spawn are created when a vampire infects another creature with vampirism without draining them of almost all blood. They are weaker versions of true vampires and cannot change form or summon creatures of the night, nor spread vampirism. Despite this, they share all vampiric weaknesses.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VampSGhulDesc;Ghul-kin are undead vampires related to Great Ghuls and often created by them.

Like other lesser vampiric creatures, they are incapable of spreading their condition.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VampSBehDesc;Death Kisses are lesser vampiric beholders whose eyestalks have become blood-draining mouths.

origin_aberrant_mind;Aberrant Mind Sorcerous Origin;;;;;;;;;;;x
origin_aberrant_mind_desc;Shadowed eyes watching, whispers within this character's mind, and the echoes of mad gods trail in this character's wake. This character's mind and body has been touched by forces abominable, things unknowable, by forces uncaring. They could wield great power over the hearts and souls of mortals, their psyche a mere toy for this character's amusemortalst. Though they should beware, mortals who play the cruel cat may meet the hungry dog.;;;;;;;;;;;x
origin_draconic;Draconic Sorcerous Origin;;;;;;;;;;;x
origin_draconic_desc;Pride, elegance, and power, are but some description of all things Draconic. This character's powers come from the intermingling of Dragons and the weaker races. Whether it was the mutual trade of knowledge, or perhaps a story fit for a bawdy tavern, they bear the burden of magical might. Will they resist the temptation of tyranny, or embrace it? Will they be a paragon of justice? Or perhaps something else?;;;;;;;;;;;x
origin_divine_soul;Divine Soul Sorcerous Origin;;;;;;;;;;;x
origin_divine_soul_desc;Visions of Heaven fill this character's dreams. Songs of cherubs ring this character's ears. Forces beyond the realm of mortals have touched them, making them a vessel of Divine power. But is this truly this character's fate? Are they a pawn, in this great cosmic game, or does this character's destiny hold more? Churches and cults either fear or revere them, but who will they prove right in the very end?;;;;;;;;;;;x
origin_shadow;Shadow Sorcerous Origin;;;;;;;;;;;x
origin_shadow_desc;Ever since childhood, the darkness has been this character's home. Things morbid and grim seemed to surround them, but never did they fear its touch. From the sorrow filled lands of Shadowfell, their powers originate. A land of death and cold winds, this character's body and soul have taken on these aspects. Where they walk, a cold spectre follows this character, as their touch fills others with the warmth of graves.;;;;;;;;;;;x
origin_storm;Storm Sorcerous Origin;;;;;;;;;;;x
origin_storm_desc;The caress of the wind was like a second mother for this character. The howling of gales and storms never daunted this character in their travels. They are a child of storms, wind and lightning answer this character's beck and call. The heavens themselves move with this character's power, and the air surrounding them is their shield. Perhaps the very elementalists themselves sired them, or perhaps a djinn touched this character's bloodline.;;;;;;;;;;;x
origin_wild_magic;Wild Magic Sorcerous Origin;;;;;;;;;;;x
origin_wild_magic_desc;Chaos is the only constant in this character's disorderly life. Magic has been with them since early childhood, with all the terror and joy it brings. What did they lose, what price did they pay, to be equally blessed and cursed by the very forces of creation? A danger they are to both friend and foe, they must endure these hardships, or simply perish.;;;;;;;;;;;x
