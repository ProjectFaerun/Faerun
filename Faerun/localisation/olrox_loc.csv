bhaalspawn3desc;The murderous god Bhaal foresaw his death and impregnated many mortal women, creating his heirs, the Bhaalspawn. If Bhaal's plans had gone as they were meant to, the Bhaalspawn would have destroyed each other until none remained, at which point his chosen followers would have performed rituals that would have brought him back. As a side effect unintended by Bhaal, the Bhaalspawn's share of the essence meant that each of them had the potential to become a god in their own right. That has come to pass today, as the last Bhaalspawn claims godhood.;;;;;;;;;;;x

However, having his essence stifled and sealed off by his last host has weakened the Lord of Murder. He is no longer a true deity, and is instead a being of quasi-divine status.;;;;;;;;;;;x

BANERETURNTITLE.1;The Return of Bane;;;;;;;;;;;x
BaneReturn.1;During the Time of Troubles, Bane and the young god Torm killed each other in battle. Subsequently, the majority of Bane's power fell from him to the mortal Cyric, who temporarily claimed the powers of all the Dead Three — all of whom perished in the Time of Troubles. A smaller portion fell to Bane's son, Iyachtu Xvim, an eventuality that Bane had anticipated should he himself perish. For Bane, death was but a temporary setback: today Xvim, who was in fact little more than a cocoon to contain the essence of Bane, burst forth into the black and armored figure of Bane, destroying the younger god entirely. All of Xvim's followers are quickly converting back to their old patron.;;;;;;;;;;;x

SACRIFICE.1002.ABYSSAL;The lords of the Abyss are hungry tonight - I can feel it. The prisoners are spread-eagled, lashed hand and foot to wooden stakes.
