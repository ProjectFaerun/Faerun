fr_uprising_desc_title.1;Murmurs of Discontent;;;;;;;;;;;x
fr_uprising_desc.1;From your humble beginnings as a tribe on the wild fringes of Toril you have come far. You now stand at the head of a mighty warhost of your own making, the fealty of the prideful warriors that comprise it a testament to your skill as a leader.\n Nevertheless, your spirited and independent vassals are loyal only out of respect. A fragile respect that hinges upon satisfying their need for prominence without upsetting the fiery egoes of their peers.\n The fervent unity of your host can easily evaporate overnight if some petty rivalry or another cascades in all out warfare amongst the clans. Equitable destribution of conquered lands and booty would go a long way in forestalling this outcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fr_uprising_desc_opt.1a;A challenge beyond the reach of weapons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fr_uprising_desc_title.2;Signs of Fracture;;;;;;;;;;;x
fr_uprising_desc.2;The spoils from your recent conquests are great and bountiful, but it is that wealth that has set off a fierce squabble among your chiefs.\n\n By asserting your primacy you managed to avert an all-out brawl in the encampment, but unfortunately this has merely turned their ire towards you instead of placating it.\n\n Your resentful chiefs are starting to be more vocal about perceived slights and injustices, every implication of favourtism or avarice blown out of proportion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fr_uprising_desc_opt.2a;Worrying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fr_uprising_desc_title.3;A Show of Generosity;;;;;;;;;;;x
fr_uprising_desc.3;The resentment of prideful warriors is no easy thing to quell, but pomp and circumstance are tried and true salves to bruised egoes.\n Perhaps making a big show of granting a portion of your demesne might be sufficient in placating the growing undercurrent of rebellion not just amongst your chiefs, but with their followers as well, who take the malignment of their liege's honour personally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

fr_uprising_desc_title.8;Descent into Chaos;;;;;;;;;;;x
fr_uprising_desc.8;At first you payed no heed to the sounds of destruction from the massive brawl in the encampment, for it has become quite the common occurence in your host. However, [designated_rebel_nomad.GetTitledFirstName]'s pontification about your apparent disrespect of your [designated_rebel_nomad.GetTitle]s must have been the final straw for many of the more prouder warriors under your command, for you quickly find yourself having to slay scores of your personal retinue as they turned on you in anger.\n\n Despite your best efforts to quell the situation, many of your subjects have rallied around [designated_rebel_nomad.GetTitledFirstName] to "reclaim what is due to the clans".\n\n Even if you survive this ordeal, the warhost itself might not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

fr_uprising_desc.15;As the warhost of your liege grows, the ambition and greed of the chiefs have come to the fore, especially when it comes to the distribution of the spoils of war.\n\n [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s might is such that no one directly questions them and their right as conquerer, but their avarice and favourtism is rankling to many who feel like their contributions are not adequately recognized. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

fr_prepared_invasion_desc_opt.16a;Great News!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fr_prepared_invasion_desc.16b;Pre-emptive hostilities with [From.GetTitledName] has disrupted [From.GetHerHis] invasion of your realm, the chaos scattering their recruited forces and ground their momentum to a halt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fr_prepared_invasion_desc.16c;Your subordination to [Root.Liege.GetTitledName] has been sufficiently intimidating to the point of engendering chaos in the camps of [From.GetTitledName], disrupting [From.GetHerHis] invasion of your realm for the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fr_prepared_invasion_desc.16d;[From.GetTitledName] left behind many things when they adopted a drastically different way of life, including their appetite for an invasion of your realm for the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fr_prepared_invasion_desc.16e;Your recent expansion of the realm was a sufficient demonstration of your power it seems, for [From.GetTitledName]'s rabble looks to have lost their enthusiasm for war and are deserting en masse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fr_prepared_invasion_desc.16f;Despite your recent territorial losses, there is a silver lining to all this: Your realm is sufficiently meager that [From.GetTitledName] no longer considers you worthy of invasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fr_prepared_invasion_desc.16g;With the death of [From.GetTitledName] goes the threat of invasion, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fr_prepared_invasion_desc.17a;End of an Invasion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fr_prepared_invasion_desc.17b;Pre-emptive hostilities with [prep_invader_target.GetTitledName] has disrupted the flow of warriors and arms into your staging grounds. Many of the warriors, carried away by the atmosphere, have staged disorganised raids on their own and have lost contact with the main host. Some of the more prideful ones have dispersed, upset that their assent was not sought. Rumours are already spreading that the invasion has already begun, discouraging latecomers from turning up and infuriating many who feel like they were left behind by the main host.\n The momentum of the invasion has been irrevocably lost. It is unlikely you will be able to attempt this again in your lifetime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fr_prepared_invasion_desc.17c;The subordination of [prep_invader_target.GetTitledName] by [prep_invader_target.Liege.GetTitledName] has had unforseen effects on the momentum of your invasion. Many of your recruited warriors are intimidated by the prospect of battling a larger, united force and have lost their spirit. The mercenaries you have attracted with promises of easy plunder thus have left to find easier targets. Worst of all, a worrying number are sympathetic to [persistent_event_target:prep_invader_target.Liege.GetTitledName]'s cause and have left citing concerns of honour.\n The momentum of the invasion has been irrevocably lost. It is unlikely you will be able to attempt this again in your lifetime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fr_prepared_invasion_desc.17d;Many of your people have proven their loyalty to you in emulating your new way of life, but in doing so have left behind their appetite for warfare. While the adventurers and mercenaries flocking under your banner may still do battle, it will be an impossible task to achieve victory without the assent of your subjects. In any case, you have your hands full managing the tension between those that yet keep to the old ways and those that have followed your example.\n The momentum of the invasion has been irrevocably lost. It is unlikely you will be able to attempt this again in your lifetime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fr_prepared_invasion_desc.17e;With the recent expansion of [prep_invader_target.GetTitledName]'s realm, it has become a power to be reckoned with. Many of your recruited warriors are intimidated by the prospect of battling a larger, united force and have lost their spirit. Many are mercenaries looking for easy plunder and thus have left to find easier targets. The cowardice of the gathered warriors seems to be affecting your people as well and calls for caution are unfortunately increasing. \n The momentum of the invasion has been irrevocably lost. It is unlikely you will be able to attempt this again in your lifetime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fr_prepared_invasion_desc.17f;With the recent string of defeats suffered by [prep_invader_target.GetTitledName], their realm has weakened to the point of insignificance. Neither mercenaries seeking plunder nor adventurers seeking glory will waste their time on such a target, and you were unable to redirect their ardour to another target before enough of them have deserted to make the invasion unfeasible.\n The momentum of the invasion has been irrevocably lost. It is unlikely you will be able to attempt this again in your lifetime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
