DECADENCE_DESC;All adult Zakharan men below the rank of Count risk acquiring the §YDecadent§! trait, especially those of low character. The amount of Decadence these men incur on their dynasty depends on their own social status as well as the total amount of Holdings controlled by the Dynasty. Decadence affects the tax income from your demesne and the morale damage that demesne levies take in battle. Ways to halt or decrease Decadence include:\n§G*§! Granting landed titles to dynasty members\n§G*§! Successfully convincing decadent Dynasty members to abandon their sinful ways\n§G*§! Imprisoning, banishing or killing decadent Dynasty members\n§G(The Religion View contains a list of decadent dynasty members.)§!;Tout Zakharan adulte qui n'a pas au moins le rang de comte risque de devenir §Ydécadent§!, en particulier s'il fait montre d'un faible caractère. Le niveau de décadence que ces hommes font rejaillir sur leur dynastie dépend de leur propre statut social, ainsi que du nombre de propriétés contrôlées par la dynastie. La décadence affecte les revenus maximaux générés dans le domaine, ainsi que les pertes de moral que les troupes du domaine subissent au combat. Pour freiner la décadence, voire la réduire, vous pouvez :\n§G*§! Donner des titres et des terres aux membres de la dynastie\n§G*§! Convaincre les membres décadence de la dynastie d'abandonner leur conduite pécheresse\n§G*§!

Die Menge an Dekadenz, welche diese Männer in ihre Dynastie einbringen, hängt von ihrem sozialen Status und der Anzahl der von der Dynastie kontrollierten Besitztümer ab. Dekadenz beeinflusst das Steuereinkommen der Domäne und die Moralschäden im Kampf. Möglichkeiten, Dekadenz zu verringern:\n§G*§! Landtitel an Dynastiemitglieder vergeben\n§G*§! Erfolgreiches Überzeugen von Dynastiemitgliedern, ihren sündigen Weg zu verlassen.\n§G*§!

Decadencia afecta los ingresos de los impuestos de tus dominios y el daño de moral que reciben las tropas del dominio durante el combate. Modos de parar o reducir la decadencia incluyen:\n§G*§!
