###Magic Apprentice###;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FMU_0002;Your apprentice has shown the basics of magical training, learning enough not to kill themselves, hopefully. But there's many professions in the magical world, and setting them down this path will likely lose them for decades, if not centuries.;;;;;;;;;;;x

###Robber Baron###;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FRE_0001;My lord, it would seem your robber knights have elected amongst themselves a Baron, and now this warrior has come to your court seeking employment under your banner. What shall we do with this ruffian?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FRE_0001;I have just the job in mind...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FRE_0001;A jumped up bandit? Call for my guards.;;;;;;;;;;;x

###Reigned too long###;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FCE_0001;I have reigned for long enough that my rulership is starting to be taken for granted. Some of my vassals have come to chafe at the lack of advancement opportunities in the realm and will likely make trouble if they remain in power.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FCE_0001;Worrying to have such conspirators amongst the vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FCE_0001;My most loyal subject, perish these thoughts of sedition and discourse...;;;;;;;;;;;x

###Republic Ruler Reigned too long###
EVTDESC_FCE_0011;[long_reigning_doge.GetTitledFirstName] has ruled for so many years, it has become hard to remember a time when [long_reigning_doge.GetSheHe] wasn't in charge. Some people are starting to think of [long_reigning_doge.GetHerHim] as more of a feudal overlord than as a leader of a republic. Perhaps it's time to do something about that?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FCE_0011;Time to finance some naysayers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FCE_0011;I'll convince everyone that a change at the top is for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FCE_0011;I know how to spread malicious rumors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_FCE_0011;Nonsense, I'm a loyal vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FCE_0012;Many of your vassals and courtiers are unhappy with your long reign at the helm of our republic. There are even rumors that you're planning to turn our nation into a full-blown feudal monarchy...many are asking that you step down, for the good of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FCE_0012;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FCE_0012;I AM the republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#COURT MAGE OPTIONS
EVTDESC_FMU_0013_WITCH;Your rangers report a suspected witch living in the outskirts of the realm. She is known for practicing sorcery, and the local villagers do not trust her. She is willing to put her spellcasting expertise to good use in your court and offers to become your court mage in exchange for naught but a small vial of your blood. A most strange offer.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FMU_0013;A small vial of my blood? I see nothing wrong with that!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FMU_0013_TIEFLING;A wanderer comes to your court, hiding their features in a deep cowled hood. A faint smell of brimstone pervades the room as they extend an offer to become your court mage. All they seek is the security and hospitality of your court.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FMU_0013;This sounds like someone I can trust.;;;;;;;;;;;x

BEHOLDERPREG.1;Today you awoke to find a swelling beneath your tongue. Dipping into your racial memories, you know what this means: you are pregnant. You must gorge yourself with as much food as you can, for this swelling will soon block your entire maw.;;;;;;;;;;;x
BEHOLDERPREG.1a;My rivals will seek to exploit this!;;;;;;;;;;;x
BEHOLDERPREG.2;The time has come. The swollen egg-womb filling your mouth is now ready to hatch. You unhinge your jaw and spit it out, biting off the tissue connecting it to you. From the bloody mess emerge several tiny beholders. You can stand only one of the wretches, so one will be picked and the rest driven off.;;;;;;;;;;;x
BEHOLDERPREG.2a;You. You look the most like me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
BEHOLDERDREAM.1;As you sleep, your dreams take an unsual turn and you dream of a beholder, quite like yourself but not quite as perfect as you are. When you wake up, you are surprised to see that very same beholder has appeared before you. They seem somewhat disoriented, but appear to recognize your superiority. For now, anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;x
BEHOLDERDREAM.1a;I suppose I can take you under my tutelage.;;;;;;;;;;;x
BEHOLDERDREAM.1b;Away, foul impostor!;;;;;;;;;;;x
BEHOLDERDREAM.2;Lately your dreams have been taking you to dark places, and this one is perhaps the greatest example of this. You dream that you die, and yet remain alive somehow. Beyond death. When you awake, you find that during your sleep your flesh and organs have sloughed off and you are now undead - a death tyrant.;;;;;;;;;;;x
BEHOLDERDREAM.2a;Not even death can stop me!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ABOLETHEGG.1;The wait is finally over. The egg you laid five years ago has finally hatched and a spawn slithers forth, ready to join you in your efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ABOLETHEGG.1a;Come, spawnling, there is much to do.;;;;;;;;;;;x
USURPER_HOST;Usurper Host;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRDOF.2;Terrible news - [From.GetBestName] has amassed a host of warriors who [From.GetSheHe] has convinced that you are weak unfit to rule! Now they assemble on our borders and march on your lands. Only war will dissuade them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRDOF.2a;The gods will see I am worthy!;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.19;Despite its significance, Midwinter Night's celebrations take very little organizing. The holy day consists of an entire night's worth of dancing on ice to both exalt [Root.AurilLoc] herself as well as to attract new worshippers to her service. It is an uncharacteristic enjoyable celebration for a harsh goddess.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.19a;A beautiful night for a dance.;;;;;;;;;;;x

embraced_by_auril;Embraced by [Root.AurilLoc];;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.20;As you ready yourself to undergo the Embrace, the [Root.AurilLocAdj] priests dress you in nothing but a smock and a pair of boots. Then they begin the ritual that will conjure up the blizzard you will need to brave in order to prove your devotion.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.20a;I will prove myself.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DEATH_AURIL_EMBRACE;was judged unworthy by [Root.AurilLoc];;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.21;You don't know how long you have been walking through the blizzard, but you have started to feel an odd sensation - you are feeling warm, even though your limbs as sluggish. A great sense of fatigue overtakes you. Maybe resting wouldn't be so bad.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.21a;I'll just... close my eyes for a bit...;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.22;Though you have been walking through the blizzard for what feels like too long, you endure. The cold bites at you, saps your strength, but by sheer determination and the favour of [Root.AurilLoc], you persevere. You have a feeling there isn't much more to go now.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.22a;Faith will preserve me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.23;The cold remains, but it no longer seems to bother you. It becomes comforting, even. Instead of disorienting you, the blizzard seems to shelter you. You can feel a presence, infinitely greater than yourself, watching over you. As the blizzard dies down, the priests confirm what you already know.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.23a;The Frostmaiden is with me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.24;Searching for a target of your violence while ranging in enemy lands, you come across [combatant_2.GetBestName]. It doesn't take long to back [ecombatant_2.GetHerHim] into a corner and initiate a deadly confrontation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.24a;Fight, and die!;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.25;After contacting the local [Root.GaragosLocAdj] priests and giving them money for their trouble, you stand at a Blood Festival. To honor the Reaver, a mighty creature is slain and its flesh is eaten raw, while its blood is used by the priests to perform benedictions upon the faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.25a;Victory for [Root.GaragosLoc]! Now and always!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39240;There are rumors that one of the [Root.Religion.GetName] rulers in the Realms is employing a heathen in their court. This is not acceptable to the Church, and this earthly lord will surely be damned unless we intervene.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP392401;will hear the clerical emissary.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39241;An emissary from [From.GetTitledFirstName] has arrived in our court. According to the emissary, the [From.GetRulerTitle] is concerned about our employment of heathens as advisors.  The [From.GetRulertitle] is asking of me to remove them from position.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39243;An emissary has returned from [From.GetBestName] bearing glorious news. The emissary says that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has agreed to imprison a heathen that was in [From.GetHerHis] court.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA39243;Praise be!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39244;This is a day that the has caused cries of joy to rise up from the Wall of the Faithless. An emissary from  [From.GetBestName] is stating that [From.GetSheHe] refuse to follow our demands.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA39244;My [Root.GetPatronHighGodName], why have you forsaken me?;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HL_1500;The blood and spirit of the beast is within you. You feel it as you walk among the people - you are not like them, you are superior. And the air is fragrant with the smell of meat, it is all around you. It could all be yours for the taking, if you are careful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HL_1500;The beast is hungry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_1510;The moon is high in the night sky. She casts her light over the lands, illuminating the night. You turn your gaze skywards, sensing a strange longing. Your beast’s blood runs quicker, the moon beckons. You raise your voice in tribute to her...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HL_1530;The beasts always catch their prey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_1540;You often run and wrestle to keep fit. It is a hunger and desire for the hunt that drives you, and you often see the movement patterns of beasts before your inner eye as you train.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_1550;You consider yourself a clever person, effectively applying your mind to any problem that needs solving. You have found that true strength comes when the animal cunning of the beast is added to the human intellect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_1560;Lately, you have been feeling a strange bestial hunger as you look at some members of your court. You have been taught to control your desires like everyone else, but there is a deep animal instinct within you that keeps increasing in intensity, pressing more and more on your patience. You feel it will soon no longer be possible to control it - and perhaps you don’t want to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_1570;The lone beast will not survive, and prosperity is only possible when the pack hunts together as one. You know this, and you feel a deep need to include everyone and thus make your court stronger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_1580;The prey starts and flees at the slightest sound. The prey is fearful. The beast goes forth without fear, knowing [Root.GetSheHe] will be the one to eat and not be eaten, knowing [Root.GetSheHe] will prevail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HL_1580;I am the beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_1590;The strongest are the ones who survive. The weak shall perish, such is the law of the wild. And on the wild, the beast is strongest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_1610;There is a rage that strikes you sometimes. They say your ancestors were beasts, and maybe they are right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HL_1610;Let the beast rage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_1620;Occasionally, as you look into a mirror, it occurs to you that your face more and more resembles that of a beast. It seems to be a slow but inexorable change occurring over the years. You can’t quite decide if you like it or not, but you sense that people at court have started to look at you in a funny way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_1640;The moon is high in the night sky. She casts Her light over the lands, illuminating the night. You turn your gaze skywards, basking in Her radiant love. Your beast’s blood runs quicker as She beckons to you. You slowly raise your voice in tribute to Her, howling as you would howl until the world ends. It fills you with joy, and you exult in Her being, knowing that She and you are one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.2a;Feeling restless and unable to sleep, you head out for a brief nightly walk. This proves to be an ill-advised decision, however, when a form pounces upon you. Somehow you manage to untangle yourself from the creature, which reveals itself to be some sort of humanoid wolf. It's ambush foiled, it retreats into the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.2b;Feeling restless and unable to sleep, you head out for a brief nightly walk. This proves to be an ill-advised decision, however, when a form pounces upon you.

FRWEREBEAST.2e;Gah, it bit me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.2f;Quickly cure yourself with divine magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
isdivinecaster;you are a divine spellcaster;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.3;Since the attack that night, you have found yourself having thoughts that can only be described as animalistic. And the moon, whenever it is out, seems to call to you, to something in your blood. And something lies below. Waiting to emerge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.3a;What is happening to me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.3b;A blessed change comes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.3c;Cure yourself with your magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.3d;Someone get me a healer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.4a;The moon is high in the sky, and you feel different. You look down on your body and see fur and claws and bestial muscles. You are now exactly that which attacked you not that long ago: a werewolf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.4b;The moon is high in the sky, and you feel different. You look down on your body and see fur and claws and bestial muscles. You are now exactly that which attacked you not that long ago: a wererat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.4c;The moon is high in the sky, and you feel different. You look down on your body and see fur and claws and bestial muscles. You are now exactly that which attacked you not that long ago: a weretiger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.4d;The moon is high in the sky, and you feel different. You look down on your body and see scale and claws and bestial muscles. You are now exactly that which attacked you not that long ago: a werecrocodile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.4e;Growl;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.4f;This is not a curse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.5;With this new change that has come upon you, you wonder if perhaps you should not reconsider devoting yourself to a god more attuned to your new nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.5a;[Root.SeluneLoc] shall guide me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.5b;I will hunt with [Root.MalarLoc].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.5c;My path lies with [Root.SebekLoc].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.5d;I won't turn from my faith so easily.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.6;For the last tenday, you have found yourself having thoughts that can only be described as animalistic. And the moon, whenever it is out, seems to call to you, to something in your blood. And something lies below. Waiting to emerge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

FRWEREBEAST.7d;The moon is high in the sky, and you feel different. You look down on your body and see scale and claws and bestial muscles. You are now something new: a werecrocodile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.8a;[From.GetBestName] has approached you away from others with a most peculiar offer - not only is [From.GetSheHe] a werewolf, but is offering to turn you into one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.8b;[From.GetBestName] has approached you away from others with a most peculiar offer - not only is [From.GetSheHe] a wererat, but is offering to turn you into one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

FRWEREBEAST.8e;Accept the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.8f;Refuse the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.8g;Refuse and tell everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.9a;[From.GetBestName] was quite receptive to your offer and accepted being made into a werewolf. Now all that is left is a bite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.9b;[From.GetBestName] was quite receptive to your offer and accepted being made into a wererat. Now all that is left is a bite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.9c;[From.GetBestName] was quite receptive to your offer and accepted being made into a weretiger. Now all that is left is a bite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.9d;[From.GetBestName] was quite receptive to your offer and accepted being made into a werecrocodile. Now all that is left is a bite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.9e;This will sting a little...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.10;[From.GetBestName] has refused your offer, rejecting the notion of becoming a lycanthrope. Though [From.GetSheHe] seems somewhat offended at the notion, it seems like [From.GetSheHe] is willing to keep your secret.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.10a;Disappointing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.11;Not only has [From.GetBestName] rejected your offer, but [From.GetSheHe] then immediately ran off shouting about you being a lycanthrope to all who would hear. Your secret is out, it seems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.11a;How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.12;One night, [From.GetFullName] arrives at the entrance to your cell and dismisses the guards. [From.GetSheHe] ominously unlocks the doors while staring at you and then... [From.GetSheHe] transforms into a terrible creature - a werebeast. Before you can even scream, [From.GetSheHe] lunges at you. When you come to again, you are alive, but feel... different.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.12a;What did [From.GetSheHe] do?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.13;Though [From.GetBestName] is your prisoner, you feel like [From.GetSheHe] still might be worthy of the blessing of lycanthropy. Thus on a night of full moon you go to [From.GetHerHis] cell and dismiss the guards, before transforming and granting [From.GetBestName] a taste of your power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.13a;You'll thank me one day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.26;A Feast of the Stags has been declared and you are taking part in it. As a [Root.MalarLocAdj], it is your duty to hunt for the Feast's table. Though any animal will do, hunting down a monster instead will increase your regard by the clergy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.26a;Hunt an animal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.26b;Hunt a monster;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.27;A grand table is set up in a local stretch of wilderness and soon the guests, both [Root.MalarLocAdj] and local peasants start to trickle in. Amognst the many fares in the table is your own quarry, and you spend the rest of the night feasting and trading tales with your fellow hunters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.27a;Until next year!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.28;A grand table is set up in a local stretch of wilderness and soon the guests, both [Root.MalarLocAdj] and local peasants start to trickle in. Though there are many fares in the table, your failure to bring in one yourself is noted and you need to endure being ridiculed by your fellow hunters for the rest of the night. At least the peasantry are enjoying themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.28a;What a disgrace...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRMELTPOT.1;It appears that your rule over the Border Kingdoms region has resulted in an unusual development. The various disparate peoples of the borderlands are developing their own unique identity, called, simply, "borderer".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRMELTPOT.1a;Catchy name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRMELTPOT.1b;Who cares what peasants do or don't do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRMELTPOT.2;It seems the trend of a unified identity for the people of the Border Kingdoms continues to spread, as the population of [Root.GetName] now proudly call themselves Borderers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRMELTPOT.2a;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRMELTPOT.2b;Whatever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SELDARINE.2;Practicing High Magic is a risky business, and today your Selu'taar has paid the price for it, dying in a magical backlash as the ritual unraveled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SELDARINE.2a;What a disaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SELDARINE.3;A tiny mistake can have dire consequences when practicing High Magic. And [Root.GetName] is paying the price for this mistake as the land is ravaged by uncontrolled magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SELDARINE.4;A miscalulation, a delayed gesture, a mispronunciation, any of these and more besides could've caused the spell to go awry. And instead of the desired effect, a temporary portal was opened to the Far Realm, long enough for a host of aberrations to make their way through to invade your realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SELDARINE.4a;To arms! To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SELDARINE.5;It appears that your ritual to summon an army of celestial beigns was hijacked by a nefarious force. For instead of the gleaming armies of the Seldarine, you instead have called forth a host of fallen celestials bent on carving out a realm for themselves out of your realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SELDARINE.6;[From.GetBestName] has been recalled to Arvandor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SELDARINE.8;[From.GetName] has gained more usuable land thanks to the Worldweave ritual!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SELDARINE.8a;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SELDARINE.9;[From.GetBestName] has arrived from the Feywild to your court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SELDARINE.10a;After putting out a call that you seek a Selu'taar, a High Mage, to serve in your court, [From.GetBestName] has stepped forth and offered [From.GetHerHis] services.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SELDARINE.10b;After putting out a call that you seek a Selu'taar, a High Mage, to serve in your court, [From.GetBestName] has arrived from far Evermeet and offered [From.GetHerHis] services.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SELDARINE.10c;Welcome, wise one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
