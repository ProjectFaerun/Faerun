###Magic Apprentice###;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FMU_0002;Your apprentice has grasped the basics of magical training, learning enough not to kill [From.GetHerHim]self by accident. But there's many paths to mastering the Art, and [From.GetBestName] must be guided to one where [From.GetSheHe] may thrive.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FMU_0002;No! Immortality and power is mine alone!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FMU_0002;[From.GetSheHeCap] can serve Nature as a druid.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FMU_0002;[From.GetSheHeCap] can study hard and rise as a wizard.;;;;;;;;;;;x

###Robber Baron###;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FRE_0001;My lord, it would seem your robber knights have elected amongst themselves a Baron, and now this warrior has come to your court seeking employment under your banner. What shall we do with this ruffian?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FRE_0001;I have just the job in mind...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FRE_0001;A jumped up bandit? Call for my guards.;;;;;;;;;;;x

###Reigned too long###;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FCE_0001;I have reigned for long enough that my rulership is starting to be taken for granted. Some of my vassals have come to chafe at the lack of advancement opportunities in the realm and will likely make trouble if they remain in power.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FCE_0001;Worrying to have such conspirators amongst the vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FCE_0001;My most loyal subject, perish these thoughts of sedition and discourse...;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_FCE_0001;Vile snake, you question my authority?;;;;;;;;;;;x

###Republic Ruler Reigned too long###
EVTDESC_FCE_0011;[long_reigning_doge.GetTitledFirstName] has ruled for so many years, it has become hard to remember a time when [long_reigning_doge.GetSheHe] wasn't in charge. Some people are starting to think of [long_reigning_doge.GetHerHim] as more of a feudal overlord than as a leader of a republic. Perhaps it's time to do something about that?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FCE_0011;Time to finance some naysayers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FCE_0011;I'll convince everyone that a change at the top is for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FCE_0011;I know how to spread malicious rumors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_FCE_0011;Nonsense, I'm a loyal vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FCE_0012;Many of your vassals and courtiers are unhappy with your long reign at the helm of our republic. There are even rumors that you're planning to turn our nation into a full-blown feudal monarchy...many are asking that you step down, for the good of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FCE_0012;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FCE_0012;I AM the republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#COURT MAGE OPTIONS
EVTDESC_FMU_0013_WITCH;Your rangers report a suspected witch living in the outskirts of the realm. She is known for practicing sorcery, and the local villagers do not trust her. She is willing to put her spellcasting expertise to good use in your court and offers to become your court mage in exchange for naught but a small vial of your blood. A most strange offer.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FMU_0013;A small vial of my blood? I see nothing wrong with that!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FMU_0013_TIEFLING;A wanderer comes to your court, hiding their features in a deep cowled hood. A faint smell of brimstone pervades the room as they extend an offer to become your court mage. All they seek is the security and hospitality of your court.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FMU_0013;This sounds like someone I can trust.;;;;;;;;;;;x

BEHOLDERPREG.1;Today you awoke to find a swelling beneath your tongue. Dipping into your racial memories, you know what this means: you are pregnant. You must gorge yourself with as much food as you can, for this swelling will soon block your entire maw.;;;;;;;;;;;x
BEHOLDERPREG.1a;My rivals will seek to exploit this!;;;;;;;;;;;x
BEHOLDERPREG.2;The time has come. The swollen egg-womb filling your mouth is now ready to hatch. You unhinge your jaw and spit it out, biting off the tissue connecting it to you. From the bloody mess emerge several tiny beholders. You can stand only one of the wretches, so one will be picked and the rest driven off.;;;;;;;;;;;x
BEHOLDERPREG.2a;You. You look the most like me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
BEHOLDERDREAM.1;As you sleep, your dreams take an unsual turn and you dream of a beholder, quite like yourself but not quite as perfect as you are. When you wake up, you are surprised to see that very same beholder has appeared before you. They seem somewhat disoriented, but appear to recognize your superiority. For now, anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;x
BEHOLDERDREAM.1a;I suppose I can take you under my tutelage.;;;;;;;;;;;x
BEHOLDERDREAM.1b;Away, foul impostor!;;;;;;;;;;;x
BEHOLDERDREAM.2;Lately your dreams have been taking you to dark places, and this one is perhaps the greatest example of this. You dream that you die, and yet remain alive somehow. Beyond death. When you awake, you find that during your sleep your flesh and organs have sloughed off and you are now undead - a death tyrant.;;;;;;;;;;;x
BEHOLDERDREAM.2a;Not even death can stop me!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ABOLETHEGG.1;The wait is finally over. The egg you laid five years ago has finally hatched and a spawn slithers forth, ready to join you in your efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ABOLETHEGG.1a;Come, spawnling, there is much to do.;;;;;;;;;;;x
USURPER_HOST;Usurper Host;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRDOF.2;Terrible news - [From.GetBestName] has amassed a host of warriors who [From.GetSheHe] has convinced that you are weak unfit to rule! Now they assemble on our borders and march on your lands. Only war will dissuade them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRDOF.2a;The gods will see I am worthy!;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.19;Despite its significance, Midwinter Night's celebrations take very little organizing. The holy day consists of an entire night's worth of dancing on ice to both exalt [Root.AurilLoc] herself as well as to attract new worshippers to her service. It is an uncharacteristic enjoyable celebration for a harsh goddess.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.19a;A beautiful night for a dance.;;;;;;;;;;;x

embraced_by_auril;Embraced by [Root.AurilLoc];;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.20;As you ready yourself to undergo the Embrace, the [Root.AurilLocAdj] priests dress you in nothing but a smock and a pair of boots. Then they begin the ritual that will conjure up the blizzard you will need to brave in order to prove your devotion.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.20a;I will prove myself.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DEATH_AURIL_EMBRACE;was judged unworthy by [Root.AurilLoc];;;;;;;;;;;x
DEATH_AURIL_EMBRACE_NO_KILLER;was judged unworthy by [Root.AurilLoc];;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.21;You don't know how long you have been walking through the blizzard, but you have started to feel an odd sensation - you are feeling warm, even though your limbs as sluggish. A great sense of fatigue overtakes you. Maybe resting wouldn't be so bad.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.21a;I'll just... close my eyes for a bit...;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.22;Though you have been walking through the blizzard for what feels like too long, you endure. The cold bites at you, saps your strength, but by sheer determination and the favour of [Root.AurilLoc], you persevere. You have a feeling there isn't much more to go now.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.22a;Faith will preserve me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.23;The cold remains, but it no longer seems to bother you. It becomes comforting, even. Instead of disorienting you, the blizzard seems to shelter you. You can feel a presence, infinitely greater than yourself, watching over you. As the blizzard dies down, the priests confirm what you already know.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.23a;The Frostmaiden is with me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.24;Searching for a target of your violence while ranging in enemy lands, you come across [combatant_2.GetBestName]. It doesn't take long to back [ecombatant_2.GetHerHim] into a corner and initiate a deadly confrontation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.24a;Fight, and die!;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.25;After contacting the local [Root.GaragosLocAdj] priests and giving them coin for their trouble, you stand at a Blood Festival. To honor the Reaver, a mighty creature is slain and its flesh is eaten raw, while its blood is used by the priests to perform benedictions upon the faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.25a;Victory for [Root.GaragosLoc]! Now and always!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39240;There are rumors that one of the [Root.Religion.GetName] rulers in the Realms is employing a heathen in their court. This is not acceptable to the Church, and this earthly lord will surely be damned unless we intervene.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC39241;An emissary from [From.GetTitledFirstName] has arrived in our court. According to the emissary, the [From.GetRulerTitle] is concerned about our employment of heathens as advisors.  The [From.GetRulertitle] is asking of me to remove them from position.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39243;An emissary has returned from [From.GetBestName] bearing glorious news. The emissary says that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has agreed to imprison a heathen that was in [From.GetHerHis] court.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA39243;Praise be!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39244;This is a day that the has caused cries of joy to rise up from the Wall of the Faithless. An emissary from  [From.GetBestName] is stating that [From.GetSheHe] refuse to follow our demands.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HL_1500;The blood and spirit of the beast is within you. You feel it as you walk among the people - you are not like them, you are superior. And the air is fragrant with the smell of meat, it is all around you. It could all be yours for the taking, if you are careful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HL_1500;The beast is hungry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_1510;The moon is high in the night sky. She casts her light over the lands, illuminating the night. You turn your gaze skywards, sensing a strange longing. Your beast's blood runs quicker, the moon beckons. You raise your voice in tribute to her...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HL_1530;The beasts always catch their prey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_1540;You often run and wrestle to keep fit. It is a hunger and desire for the hunt that drives you, and you often see the movement patterns of beasts before your inner eye as you train.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_1550;You consider yourself a clever person, effectively applying your mind to any problem that needs solving. You have found that true strength comes when the animal cunning of the beast is added to the human intellect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_1560;Lately, you have been feeling a strange bestial hunger as you look at some members of your court. You have been taught to control your desires like everyone else, but there is a deep animal instinct within you that keeps increasing in intensity, pressing more and more on your patience. You feel it will soon no longer be possible to control it - and perhaps you don't want to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_1570;The lone beast will not survive, and prosperity is only possible when the pack hunts together as one. You know this, and you feel a deep need to include everyone and thus make your court stronger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_1580;The prey starts and flees at the slightest sound. The prey is fearful. The beast goes forth without fear, knowing [Root.GetSheHe] will be the one to eat and not be eaten, knowing [Root.GetSheHe] will prevail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HL_1580;I am the beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_1590;The strongest are the ones who survive. The weak shall perish, such is the law of the wild. And on the wild, the beast is strongest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_1610;There is a rage that strikes you sometimes. They say your ancestors were beasts, and maybe they are right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HL_1610;Let the beast rage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_1620;Occasionally, as you look into a mirror, it occurs to you that your face more and more resembles that of a beast. It seems to be a slow but inexorable change occurring over the years. You can?t quite decide if you like it or not, but you sense that people at court have started to look at you in a funny way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HL_1640;The moon is high in the night sky. She casts Her light over the lands, illuminating the night. You turn your gaze skywards, basking in Her radiant love. Your beast's blood runs quicker as She beckons to you. You slowly raise your voice in tribute to Her, howling as you would howl until the world ends. It fills you with joy, and you exult in Her being, knowing that She and you are one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.2a;Feeling restless and unable to sleep, you head out for a brief nightly walk. This proves to be an ill-advised decision, however, when a form pounces upon you. Somehow you manage to untangle yourself from the creature, which reveals itself to be some sort of humanoid wolf. It's ambush foiled, it retreats into the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.2b;Feeling restless and unable to sleep, you head out for a brief nightly walk. This proves to be an ill-advised decision, however, when a form pounces upon you.

FRWEREBEAST.2e;Gah, it bit me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.2f;Quickly cure yourself with divine magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
isdivinecaster;This option is available because you are a divine spellcaster;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.3;Since the attack that night, you have found yourself having thoughts that can only be described as animalistic. And the moon, whenever it is out, seems to call to you, to something in your blood. And something lies below. Waiting to emerge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.3a;What is happening to me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.3b;A blessed change comes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.3c;Cure yourself with your magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.3d;Someone get me a healer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

FRWEREBEAST.4e;Growl;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.4f;This is not a curse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.5;With this new change that has come upon you, you wonder if perhaps you should not reconsider devoting yourself to a god more attuned to your new nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.5a;[Root.SeluneLoc] shall guide me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.5b;I will hunt with [Root.MalarLoc].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

FRWEREBEAST.8a;[From.GetBestName] has approached you away from others with a most peculiar offer - not only is [From.GetSheHe] a werewolf, but is offering to turn you into one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

FRWEREBEAST.8e;Accept the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.8f;Refuse the offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.8g;Refuse and tell everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.9a;[From.GetBestName] was quite receptive to your offer and accepted being made into a werewolf. Now all that is left is a bite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

FRWEREBEAST.9e;This will sting a little...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.10;[From.GetBestName] has refused your offer, rejecting the idea of becoming a lycanthrope. Though [From.GetSheHe] seems somewhat offended at the notion, it seems like [From.GetSheHe] is willing to keep your secret.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.10a;Disappointing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.11;Not only has [From.GetBestName] rejected your offer, but [From.GetSheHe] then immediately ran off shouting about you being a lycanthrope to all who would hear. Your secret is out, it seems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.11a;How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.12;One night, [From.GetFullName] arrives at the entrance to your cell and dismisses the guards. [From.GetSheHe] ominously unlocks the doors while staring at you and then... [From.GetSheHe] transforms into a terrible creature - a werebeast. Before you can even scream, [From.GetSheHe] lunges at you. When you come to again, you are alive, but feel... different.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.12a;What did [From.GetSheHe] do?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.13;Though [From.GetBestName] is your prisoner, you feel like [From.GetSheHe] still might be worthy of the blessing of lycanthropy. Thus on a night of full moon you go to [From.GetHerHis] cell and dismiss the guards, before transforming and granting [From.GetBestName] a taste of your power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.13a;You'll thank me one day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.26;A Feast of the Stags has been declared and you are taking part in it. As a [Root.MalarLocAdj], it is your duty to hunt for the Feast's table. Though any animal will do, hunting down a monster instead will increase your regard by the clergy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.26a;Hunt an animal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.26b;Hunt a monster;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.27;A grand table is set up in a local stretch of wilderness and soon the guests, both [Root.MalarLocAdj] and local peasants start to trickle in. Amognst the many fares in the table is your own quarry, and you spend the rest of the night feasting and trading tales with your fellow hunters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.27a;Until next year!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.28;A grand table is set up in a local stretch of wilderness and soon the guests, both [Root.MalarLocAdj] and local peasants start to trickle in. Though there are many fares in the table, your failure to bring in one yourself is noted and you need to endure being ridiculed by your fellow hunters for the rest of the night. At least the peasantry are enjoying themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DIVREL.28a;What a disgrace...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRMELTPOT.1;It appears that your rule over the Border Kingdoms region has resulted in an unusual development. The various disparate peoples of the borderlands are developing their own unique identity, called, simply, "borderer".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRMELTPOT.1a;Catchy name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRMELTPOT.1b;Who cares what peasants do or don't do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRMELTPOT.2;It seems the trend of a unified identity for the people of the Border Kingdoms continues to spread, as the population of [Root.GetName] now proudly call themselves Borderers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRMELTPOT.2a;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRMELTPOT.2b;Whatever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SELDARINE.2;Practicing High Magic is a risky business, and today your Selu'taar has paid the price for it, dying in a magical backlash as the ritual unraveled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SELDARINE.2a;What a disaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SELDARINE.3;A tiny mistake can have dire consequences when practicing High Magic. And [Root.GetName] is paying the price for this mistake as the land is ravaged by uncontrolled magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SELDARINE.4;A miscalulation, a delayed gesture, a mispronunciation, any of these and more besides could've caused the spell to go awry. And instead of the desired effect, a temporary portal was opened to the Far Realm, long enough for a host of aberrations to make their way through to invade your realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SELDARINE.4a;To arms! To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SELDARINE.5;It appears that your ritual to summon an army of celestial beigns was hijacked by a nefarious force. For instead of the gleaming armies of the Seldarine, you instead have called forth a host of fallen celestials bent on carving out a realm for themselves out of your realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SELDARINE.6;[From.GetBestName] has been recalled to Arvandor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SELDARINE.8;[From.GetName] has gained more usuable land thanks to the Worldweave ritual!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SELDARINE.8a;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SELDARINE.9;[From.GetBestName] has arrived from the Feywild to your court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

FIGHTEVT.14;After arduous training and service, [From.GetBestName] is ready to take the next step in the art of war. [From.GetSheHe] can now proudly call [From.GetHerHim]self a fighter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

GENMISC.12a;Am I one of those psions?;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.13a;Lately your ward, [From.GetFullName], has been displaying strange powers. Objects sometimes float and [From.GetSheHe] seems to know things you have never said. After some research, you come to the conclusion that [From.GetSheHe] is displaying budding psionic powers.;;;;;;;;;;;x

FRWEREBEAST.23e;AAAUUGH!;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.24;During one of your latest transformations into lycan form, [From.GetBestName] happened to see you. Instinctively you attacked [From.GetHerHim], killing [From.GetHerHim] before [From.GetSheHe] could escape.;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.24a;Regrettable.;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.24b;What rotten luck.;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRWEREBEAST.24c;None may threaten me!;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.1;Feeling restless and unable to sleep, you head out for a brief nightly walk. This proves to be an ill-advised decision, however, when a form pounces upon you. After a brief struggle, you manage to untangle yourself from the assailant, a pale figure with blood-red eyes. Their ambush foiled, it retreats into the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.1a;Did they bite me?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.2;Since the attack that night, you have found yourself having strange cravings for blood. And sunlight now seems intolerable to you. You are not sure, but you could swear that you are... changing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.3;It happened gradually. You felt colder, your heartbeat slowed, until you felt nothing at all. Then the craving for blood got more intense, and you could sense the life on all around you. It is obvious that what attacked you was a vampire, but you don't seem to be one exactly, but rather something... similar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.3a;I... I need blood. Now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.4;Due to your transformation, you no longer feel like your current faith is right for you, that it would accept your new nature. Perhaps it is time for a change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.4a;No! I must stay true!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.4b;Yes, a change is in order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.6;While taking a nightly stroll, you see two figures in a darker corner. Approaching, you see that it is [vampfound.GetBestName]... and [vampfound.GetHerHis] is draining the blood off the neck of some unfortunate soul! You escape before you are seen.;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.7;Unbenknownst to you at the time, [From.GetBestName] saw you feeding at some point and has let everyone know. Now your secret is out, with all that it will bring.;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.8a;[From.GetBestName] has alerted everyone to a terrible danger: [vampfound.GetBestName] is a vampire! The monster has been hiding in your midst for who knows how long.;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.8b;The latest news at court is that [From.GetBestName] has exposed [vampfound.GetBestName] as a vampire! You know there's more to some undead than the monsters most make them out to be, but it is a troublesome development.;;;;;;;;;;;x

Approaching, you see that it is [vampfound.GetBestName]... and [vampfound.GetHerHis] is draining the blood off the neck of some unfortunate soul! [From.GetBestName] notices you and attacks, but you manage to escape!.;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.11;During one of your latest feeding sessions, [From.GetBestName] happened to see you. Though you attempted to attack [From.GetHerHim], [From.GetSheHe] managed to survive and tell everyone what happened.;;;;;;;;;;;x

FRVAMP.14;While taking a nightly stroll, you see two figures in a darker corner.

[From.GetBestName] notices you and attacks, and though you tried to run it was all in vain.;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.15;During one of your latest feeding session, [From.GetBestName] happened to see you. In a panic, you attacked [From.GetHerHim], killing [From.GetHerHim] before [From.GetSheHe] could escape.;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.16;[From.GetBestName] has approached you away from others with a most peculiar offer - not only is [From.GetSheHe] a vampire, but is offering to turn you into one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.17;[From.GetBestName] was quite receptive to your offer and accepted being made into a vampire. Now all that is left is a bite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.18;[From.GetBestName] has refused your offer, rejecting the idea of becoming a vampire. Though [From.GetSheHe] seems somewhat offended at the notion, it seems like [From.GetSheHe] is willing to keep your secret.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.19;Not only has [From.GetBestName] rejected your offer, but [From.GetSheHe] then immediately ran off shouting about you being a vampire to all who would hear. Your secret is out, it seems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.20;One night, [From.GetFullName] arrives at the entrance to your cell and dismisses the guards. [From.GetSheHe] ominously unlocks the doors while staring at you and then you get a better look at [From.GetHerHim]. Red eyes, pale skin. Fangs. A vampire. Before you can even scream, [From.GetSheHe] lunges at you. When you come to again you are alive, but feel cold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.21;Though [From.GetBestName] is your prisoner, you feel like [From.GetSheHe] still might be worthy of the blessing of vampirism. Thus in the dead of night you go to [From.GetHerHis] cell and dismiss the guards, before approaching and granting [From.GetBestName] a taste of your power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.22;You awake from a nightmare. In it your life was being drained away and you could taste blood. When you awake, [From.GetBestName] is standing over you, and... are those fangs? And why do you feel so cold? [From.GetBestName] explains that you are now [From.GetHerHis] spawn and servant. You try to prostest... but can't. It seems you are truly bound to [From.GetHerHis] will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.22a;I... yes master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.23;You approach [From.GetBestName] while [From.GetSheHe] is asleep. At that point, it is trivial to drain [From.GetHerHim] and turn [From.GetHerHim] into a Spawn. When [From.GetSheHe] awakes shortly after, [From.GetSheHe] is confused and tries to resist your will, but soon finds that it is futile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.23;Arise, mine servant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.24;You awake from a fitful sleep to see [From.GetBestName] looming over you, mouth open. And then you see the fangs and blood-red eyes. A vampire! [From.GetBestName] is a vampire! Surprised at your awakening, [From.GetBestName] beats a hasty retreat, but it is too late for [From.GetHerHim]: all will know the truth now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.24a;Your nights are over!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.25;You approach [From.GetBestName] while [From.GetSheHe] is asleep. But when you are about to turn [From.GetHerHim] into your spawn, [From.GetSheHe] wakes up! You flee in the hopes of not being identified, but it is too late. [From.GetBestName] tells anyone who will listen about what has happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.25a;Damn it all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.26;In the dead of night, you wake up to see that [From.GetBestName] is standing before your cell. [From.GetSheHe] unlocks the door and walks in, and then you see that not only [From.GetSheHe] is a vampire, but must have some fell plan for you. You pass out. When you come to again, everything is changed. You've changed. [From.GetBestName] explains that you are now [From.GetHerHis] Spawn and servant. You feel compelled to obey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.27;You approach [From.GetBestName] in [From.GetHerHis] cell. Shackled, [From.GetBestName] has no chance to resist. Soon [From.GetSheHe] is your loyal undead servant, for now and ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.28;Though you could have been described as charitable once, recently you can only feel disgust at those who must depend on others rather than take what they want or need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.28a;Why should I help them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.29;You have recently come to realise that the world is divided by those who can get what they want, by any means at their disposal, and those who cannot. Condemnations of greed are merely the weak trying to supress the strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.29a;I will take what I want!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.30;There are those who preach patience is a virtue. They are wrong. Why should you wait when you are this powerful?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.30a;The world belongs to the bold!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.31;Once you perhaps thought that fury, that rage, is to be kept in check. To not be given into. Now you see that this was wrong. All will rightfuly cower before you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.31a;My wrath will not be contained!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.32;Caring for the feelings of others tires you. Bores you. Why should you give a whit about the feelings of your lessers? No longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.32a;I am the only one who matters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.33;It eats away at you. How others can have things you don't. How they can achieve what you cannot. It is unfair. A true cosmic injustice. If these cretins can have it, why can't you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.33a;How dare they be more successful than I?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.34;For a long time you held yourself to being humble. To not boast or brag. But how can you deny the greatness that is in you? That now courses through your blood? You cannot. You will not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.34a;Humility? Bah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.35;You are superior to many around you. You know it. They know it. Is it so wrong to state the obvious? To hold your head up high? No, it is not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.35a;I am quite great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.36;Placid. Complacent. Content. This was who you were. But now, the seeds of greatness have awoken in you. You realise your potential. It is time to be indolent no longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.36a;I will sieze the night!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.37;You are a predator. A master of the night. Is it not your right, your destiny, to rule? To achieve greater and greater heights? Your ambitions may be realised, if only you were to go and act on them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.37a;My destiny is nigh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.38;Some say that being harsh, being stern is evil. Cruel. You know the truth. You are strong and they are not. You impose your will onto the world, while they merely live in it. You are not the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.38a;Weaklings!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.39;To tell the truth in all things. If you were to do that, you would soon find yourself under attack by all sides by short-sighted mortals! No, the truth is a tool, not some byword to live by.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.39a;A lie every now and then won't hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.40;Lies are powerful. Through them you may shape the perceptions of other. Get them to perform your bidding. How could you not see it sooner? Deceit is not something to be shunned, but to be embraced. You see this now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.40a;And no one will ever know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.41;Justice. Nonsense! As if fairness truly ever existed in this world. No, the strong do what they want, and the weak suffer what they must. Such is the way of things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.41a;Justice is blind... and useless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.42;To judge others based on their merits, rather than how you think of them. What a silly notion. If you don't like them, that is reason enough! Anything else besides is just a waste of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.42a;Now we do things my way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.43;Trust. Such danger in a small word. You understand now that to trust is to become vulnerable. To invite in weakness. You don't need others. Only yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.43a;I trust in myself, and no other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRVAMP.44;News reaches you that [Root.GetBestName] has revealed [Root.GetHerHim]self to be a vampire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

GENMISC.17;The gods of war approve of your battles. You have gained piety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.1;You climb aboard your spelljammer, the magical vessel capable of taking you beyond the world you live in. Your crew is at the ready, and soon your vessel starts to rise. The ground grows farther and farther. Soon day turns to eternal night. You are free from the confines of Toril.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.1a;Wildspace awaits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.1b;You are now in Toril's orbit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.3;Wildspace, and the Phlogiston beyond it, is a vast place, full of opportunities and locations. While you can only travel to those places immediately near your own location, you can then from them go onwards into the unknown. Where would you like to go?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.3a;Home, back to the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.5;While travelling [Root.SpelljammerLocation] you come across another spelljamming vessel. They seem friendly enough and hail you as they pass by. You could just hail them back and move on, though you could also interact with them further. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.5a;Hail and move on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.5b;Propose a trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.5ba;The results will depend on your stewardship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.5bb;you making a profit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.5bc;you trading at a loss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.5c;Attack them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.5ca;The results will depend on your martial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.5cb;you being victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.5cc;you being defeated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.5cd;your spelljammer being destroyed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.6;You propose a quick trade with the other captain and they agree. After everything is said and done, you are sailing away with your pockets a little heavier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.6a;A fine deal indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.7;You propose a quick trade with the other captain and they agree. Unfortunately you've run into a shrewd negotiatior who managed to make a profit from you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.7a;I... *sigh*;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.8;After a quickly checking for any other vessels that may interfere, you order an attack. The combat is quick and brutal, but your crew prove themselves superior this day. The spoils are yours for the taking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.8a;To the victor...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.9;After a quickly checking for any other vessels that may interfere, you order an attack. The defending crew proves more than a match for your own, however, and you are repelled and forced to retreat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.9a;Damn it all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.10;After a quickly checking for any other vessels that may interfere, you order an attack. The defending crew proves more than a match for your own, however, and even mount a counterattack! Your spelljammer proves unable to withstand their retaliation and is consigned to the void... and you with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.11;While travelling, you run into another spelljammer. You are about to hail them when you notice they are actually pirates! What's worse, they've seen you and are approaching with clear hostile intent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRSM.11a;Evade and escape!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

GENMISC.31;Though there are several enlightened faiths, several of them share the three religious schools, the three outlooks, of Moralism, Ethoism and Pragmatism. This is not a choice made lightly, for it is frowned upon to stray from one's chosen path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.31a;Moralism. Through strict dogma we endure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.31b;Ethoism. Staying true to the gods is the sure path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.31c;Pragmatism. We must help who we can, where we can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.34;Ulutiu can often manifest through four different spirit beasts, each associated with a specific aspect of him. They are Clever Oomio the Grey Seal, Grandfather Walrus, Great White Bear, and Pindalpau-pau the Reindeer Mother. Which shall you give an offering to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.34a;Clever Oomio;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.34b;Grandfather Walrus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.34c;Great White Bear;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.34d;Pindalpau-pau;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.36t;The Fellowship of the White Owl;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.36;With the restructuring of the faith of the Sleeper in the Ice, Ulutiu, so too has arisen a martial order dedicated to defending the faith. This is the Fellowship of the White Owl, all of them hardened survivors of the harsh environs of the Great Glacier, ready to stain the ice red in defense of their renewed faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.36a;Just some frozen barbarians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.36b;Inspiring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.37;With enough supplies on hand, you retreat to a frozen and isolated cave upon which you will wait until spring in order to meditate and receive omens from Ulutiu on what the next kaiurit should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.37a;Ulutiu will provide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.38;A blizzard rages outside, as it has for several days. You wouldn't be blamed to think it would go on forever... but suddenly it dies down. After the howling of the wind for days, the silence is deafening. Could this be a sign?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.38a;But what does it mean?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.39;CRACK! You turn and see that a boulder has cracked in two from the sheer cold. Truly the power of your glacial deity is boundless, for it has defeated the very stuff of the earth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.39a;Definitely an omen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.40;You shiver. How long have you been here, in this cold and desolate place? Days? Tendays? Months? Years, perhaps? You can hardly tell anymore. Visions come to you, during the harshest moments, when you shake terribly in the unrelenting grip of frost. Are they real visions, though? Or merely hallucinations of a frozen mind?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.40a;Brrrr...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.41;Spring arrives, and you emerge from your icy seclusion. When you return to your people you will have to proclaim the kaiurit, the religious law that will have to be obeyed by all until the next iurit is performed. What shall it be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.41a;Above all else, survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.41b;Prepare for war.;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.41c;Reach out, make allies.;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.41d;Thrive, even in the harshest of places.;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.42;It's only a few days before your hunters return, with the infant animal that will be the Kaitotem in tow. It is unharmed, as were any others of its kind they found in the process of capture, as is decreed. Now all you need is to take very good care of it for the next year.;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.42a;We will not be found wanting.;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.43;The kaitotem beast has somehow found its way to some of the food stores of [Root.Location.GetName]. It gorged itself on them and is now quite happy, but the damage is not insignificant.;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.43a;Sigh.;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.44;A local troublemaker has, while drunk, decided it would be fun to torment the kaitotem beast. Needless to say this is unacceptable and the perpetrator was swiftly dealt with. At the same time, the beast is now hurt and that must be addressed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.44a;Spare no expense in healing it!;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.44b;It will have to endure.;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.45;The Kaitotem beast has fallen ill. It is an unfortunate event, but one beyond your control. Still, you might be able to secure healing for the animal, though it will cost you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.46;Apparently, some local children decided to sneak into the pen of the Kaitotem beast to play with it. Predictably, this led to one of the children getting hurt, though not too seriously.;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.46a;At least the animal is happy?;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.48;The time has come. A full year has passed and now the Kaitotem beast is being possessed by one of the spirit beasts of Ulutiu. It strides off into the wilderness, but not before looking at you with what seems to be aproval.;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.48a;Praise Ulutiu!;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.49;The time has come. A full year has passed and now the Kaitotem beast is being possessed by one of the spirit beasts of Ulutiu. It strides off into the wilderness without ever looking back. You feel as though you have failed the ritual.;;;;;;;;;;;x
GENMISC.49a;May Ulutiu have mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
OBOULD.1;Your scouts report that a rival warband of orcs under a "King Greneire" has come down from the Spine of the World near Dark Arrow Keep. His goal is clear: to take your territory, especially Citadel Many-Arrows.;;;;;;;;;;;x
OBOULD.1a;We'll see who is really king here!;;;;;;;;;;;x
CLAN_WARCROWN;Clan Warcrown;;;;;;;;;;;x
OBOULD.2;Though you have triumphed over the would-be-conqueror Greneire, a new threat has arisen: a host of dwarves from Clan Warcrown now march from Silverymoon! Their intent is to reclaim Citadel Many-Arrows and restore it to Citadel Felbarr.;;;;;;;;;;;x
OBOULD.2a;Damn them!;;;;;;;;;;;x
OBOULD.3;As the siege of Mithral Hall progresses, your shamans call you to a religious ceremony. Apparently they have received omens from the gods that you must undergo a ritual. The ritual itself is like a blur, you cannot remember all the details save one: Gruumsh Himself speaking to you, commending your leadership. And more, Him choosing you to be his Chosen in the Realms. Once the ritual is over you feel stronger, faster, smarter. You are changed. You are Chosen.;;;;;;;;;;;x
OBOULD.3a;Gruumsh won't find me wanting.;;;;;;;;;;;x
OBOULD.4;At last your life comes to an end. You did great things. The founding of Many-Arrows, being Chosen by Gruumsh himself. Whatever the Realms have in store for your kingdom and people will have to be handled by another. And yet, as your soul leaves your body to head to the afterlife you find yourself face-to-face with Gruumsh One-Eye. He commends you, your faith, your skills, your deeds. And he wishes to reward you. To elevate you to be his exarch. The orcish deity of statecraft in his pantheon. You don't think twice. You accept.;;;;;;;;;;;x
OBOULD.4a;Together, we are strong.;;;;;;;;;;;x
OBOULD.5t;Exarch;;;;;;;;;;;x
OBOULD.5;All of your shamans and priests and holy people have received a vision from the gods. And they all relay this: a new god has joined their pantheon: Obould Many-Arrows, Gruumsh's exarch and god of orcish statecraft. Already some swear themselves to the new god. This is a momentous day for your faith and people. The Realms will feel the repercussions of this for centuries to come.;;;;;;;;;;;x
OBOULD.5a;Praise Gruumsh! Praise Obould!;;;;;;;;;;;x
FRMAINT.52;Due to a lack of Andt ranchers, the catoblepas were put down in [Root.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;x
FAEGODS.1;There are many gods and powers in the Realms, and the faithful will often choose one to dedicate themselves to. Which shall you follow?;;;;;;;;;;;x
FAEGODSRE;Re, god of the Sun and Pharaohs.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VELSHAROON.1t;Apotheosis;;;;;;;;;;;x
VELSHAROON.1;Finally, after much work you have managed to brew the potion whose recipe was revealed to you so many years ago by Talos in the Plains of Purple Dust. A potion that will make you a god. In but a few moments, the shackles of mortality will hold you no longer.\n\nAlmost quivering in anticipation you raise the potion to your lips and drink, careful not to spill a single drop. It tastes foul. It tastes amazing. There are no mortal words to describe it. Immortal words flood to your mind instead.\n\nApotheosis is yours, and it is a rush like no other. You are now the god of necromancy. Already you send out omens to promising mortals. There is much to do.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VELSHAROON.1a;An unliving god!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VELSHAROON.1b;The Planes await.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VELSHAROON.2;The news is spreading across the clerical community like wildfire. A new deity has arisen, and a nefarious one too: Velsharoon, the Archmage of Necromancy.\n\nRumours say that he was once a mortal wizard, one who found a way to become divine. Others still say he's an interloper god from another world.\n\nWhatever the case might be, undeath is ascendant on this day, and evil necromancers of all kinds carefully ponder their religious allegiances.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VELSHAROON.2a;Concerning.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VELSHAROON.2b;Interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;x
