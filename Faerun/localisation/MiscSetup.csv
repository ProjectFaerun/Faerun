ERA_CHAR_NAME_7001;Piergeiron, son of Athar 'the Shining Knight' was the public face of the secretive Lords of Waterdeep.

BM_DARK_ZAKHARA;Dark Zakhara;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_FAERUN_SKYFIRE_DESC;The magical cataclysm of the Spellplague has freed the ancient and mighty genies Calim and Memnon from their prison in the Calim Desert.

BM_DARK_POWERS_ERA;Dark Powers Return;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_DARK_POWERS_ERA_DESC;The year 1372 saw the surprising reemergence of several insidious dark powers that were believed to be gone for good. The Netherese city of Thultanthar returned to the world of Faerûn and its evil leader, Telamont Tanthul, begun an invasion of the Realms, determined to restore Netheril. Bane, god of tyranny, also returned to Faerûn, bursting forth from the skin of his son, Iyachtu Xvim. His divinity restored, Bane appointed the High Priest Fzoul Chembryl, leader of the Zhentarim, as his Chosen. In the North, the Treaty of Garumn's Gorge officially recognizes the Kingdom of Many-Arrows: the first true Orc kingdom in ages, and a great threat to the newly born confederation of the Silver Marches.

ERA_CHAR_INFO_56006;Fzoul Chembryl, the ambitious High Priest of Bane, joined the Zhentarim and served as second-in-command to its leader, Lord Manshoon, for years, seemingly content with his position.

At the same time, he began scheming against Manshoon, eventually replacing him as leader of the Zhentarim. Fzoul intended to turn the organization into an arm of Xvim's church.

With the kingdom weakened by Nalavarauthatoryl's failed invasion, an unexpected Shadovar threat rising in nearby Anauroch, and an infant on the throne, Cormyr's destiny in these troubled times was uncertain.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_OBOULD;Obould Many-Arrows;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_30550;Obould was the king of the orcs of the Citadel of Many Arrows in 1367 DR. He lost this city when an orc horde led by King Greneire attacked the Citadel in the summer of that year.

Obould retreated to Dark Arrow Keep, amassed a new army, and finally put his plans into action. Through sheer military acumen, he realized his goal of uniting most of the orc tribes in the Spine of the World. Because of his unprecedented successes, he was deemed worthy of being blessed by the orc god Gruumsh, effectively becoming a Chosen of the orc god.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_ALUSTRIEL;Alustriel Silverhand;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_AFTER_THE_RAGE;After the Rage;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_AFTER_THE_RAGE_DESC;The Year of Rogue Dragons saw the great madness known as the Rage of Dragons overwhelm many of Faerûn's dragons. By the time it was over, older dragons had established new power structures, and younger ones had come to fresh prominence. And many, dragons and non-dragons alike, expressed new interest in draconic paths of belief - both the Draconic faith, and the sinister Cult of the Dragon. With the death of its founder Sammaster at the end of the preceding year, the Cult is seeking new ways to spread the power of undead dragons...;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_FAERUN_BTS;Before the Storm;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FAERUN_BTS_DESC;In the Year of the Prince, the inhabitants of the Realms had no idea of the turmoil that was to come in the following decades. And yet, Faerûn was not free of its own tribulations at the time. Tyrants make themselves felt and old evils stir. And, in the far east, a man would take the scattered Tuigan tribes, and forge them into something that the entire world would fear...;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_ZHENGYI;Zhengyi;;;;;;;;;;;x

This lack of popularity proved his undoing shorly after the Time of Troubles, when, weakened by having few true worshippers, he was slain by Tiamat.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_MOURNGRYM;Lord Mourngrym Amcathra;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_7048;Mourngrym Amcathra was a noble from Waterdeep, leaving his life of luxury early in his adulthood to become an adventurer and a Harper.

BM_FAERUN_SPELLSCAR;Spellscarred World;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FAERUN_SPELLSCAR_DESC;Though it has been almost a century since the Spellplague ravaged the entire world, and beyond, the Realms still feel the after-effects of this cataclysm. The death of Mystra at the hands of Cyric not only sent all of the Weave into chaos, but also briefly merged together the twin worlds of Abeir and Toril, displacing various realms of each into the other. Now the world is finally recovering, though blue flame still ravages large swathes of the planet.;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_TYRANNY_OF_DRAGONS;Tyranny of Dragons;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_TYRANNY_OF_DRAGONS_DESC;In the 1480s, the Cult of the Dragon was taken over by a faction that revered Tiamat, rather than maintaining the Cult's traditional focus on dracoliches.

But many dragons, and even some cult members, did not believe in this radical vision, and joined those who opposed it.;;;;;;;;;;;x 
ERA_CHAR_NAME_SEVERIN;Severin Silrajin;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_42269;Wyrmspeaker Severin Silrajin was the driving force behind the dramatic changes in the Cult of the Dragon during the 1480s.

BM_FAERUN_TORIL_HEALED;Toril Restored;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FAERUN_TORIL_HEALED_DESC;At the ending years of the tumultuous 15th century, the Realms underwent what would be called the Second Sundering, when Chosen walked the lands and long-dead gods came back to life. Much of the damage of the dreaded Spellplague was also undone, and the world breathes a sigh of relief. It came at a cost, however, as gods are now more distant when it comes to mortal matters, and evils old and new prepare to make their move before the world truly stabilizes.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_DAGULT;Lord Dagult Neverember;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_15122;Dagult Nevermeber was the supposed descendant of Lord Nasher Alagondar through a bastard, and was once the Open Lord of Waterdeep before being expelled to Neverwinter.

ERA_CHAR_INFO_9248;Thavius Kreeg was outwardly known as both a devout priest of Torm and ruler of Elturel.  He made Elutrel the capital of the realm of Elturgard after saving the city from a group of vampires by summoning a small sun, the Companion, that from then on floated above the city. In actuality, he had sold his soul to the archdevil Zariel to achieve that victory and would later doom his entire city to the Nine Hells in an event known as the Descent.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1011;After the people of Unther were displaced into the world of Abeir, they faced much adversity and were even enslaved by the Shyran genasi. The desperation of the Untheric people led to the resurgence of a new incarnation of Gilgeam, this time calling himself the Son of Victory. In the course of his war against the genasi, Gilgeam made a pact with the archdemon Graz'zt to bolster his forces, but just as he was about to win the war, he and his people were returned to Unther. There, he found the dragonborn of Tymanther occupying the lands of his people, and he immediately declared war on them. That war, however, devolved into a stalemate after the interference of both Asmodeus and Gilgeam's father, Enlil.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_NSI;Ras Nsi;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_52803;Ras Nsi was once one of the Barae, the Chosen of the primordial Ubtao.

He also underwent terrible rituals that transformed him from human into a yuan-ti malison, and allied himself with the lich Acererak to achieve his goals of dominating Chult.;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_HONOR_AMONG_THIEVES;Honor Among Thieves;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_HONOR_AMONG_THIEVES_DESC;Dagult Neverember lies in a mysterious coma. In his place, the charismatic Forge Fitzwilliam has swept to power as Lord of Neverwinter.

BM_YEAR_OF_BLUE_FIRE;The Wailing Years;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_YEAR_OF_BLUE_FIRE_DESC;1385 DR became known as the year the Realms shook when the Spellplague consumed vast areas of the world and the planes themselves shifted. In the early days of that year, however, none suspected what was to come, not even its instigator, the treacherous god Cyric.;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_AFTERMATH;The Aftermath;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_AFTERMATH_DESC;The Wailing Years were a decade of turmoil, when the Spellplague was at its strongest and Toril and Abeir frequently overlapped and swapped regions. In the aftermath of that period, arcane magic stabilised enough that the many peoples of both worlds could start to recover, to rebuild their lives and kingdoms. But such periods are rife with opportunity for those brave or unscrupulous enough to take it;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FAERUN_RONIN_CHALLENGE;The Imperial Challenger;;;;;;;;;;;x

There, his sanity and loyalty were both shattered by the dark spirits of the fallen citadel, leading him to declare himself the true inheritor of Anok-Imaskar and Emperor of Shou Lung and prepare for war. Unbeknownst to him were the machinations of Nung Chiang, of the Nine Immortals, who sought to prevent the devastation such a conflict would bring.;;;;;;;;;;;x
