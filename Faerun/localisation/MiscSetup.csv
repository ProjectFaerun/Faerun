Now calling himself Yamun Khahan of the Tuigan Horde, he turns westward and is poised to sweep into Faerûn.

BM_DARK_ZAKHARA;Dark Zakhara;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_DARK_ZAKHARA_DESC;The shadows have long been lengthening over the sunny lands of Zakhara. Grand Caliph Khalil's failure to settle his succession has brought his disturbed cousin Makin to the Enlightened Throne.

BM_DARK_POWERS_ERA_DESC;The year 1372 saw the surprising reemergence of several insidious dark powers that were believed to be gone for good. The Netherese city of Thultanthar returned to the world of Faerûn and its evil leader, Telamont Tanthul, begun an invasion of the Realms, determined to restore Netheril. Bane, god of tyranny, also returned to Faerûn, bursting forth from the skin of his son, Iyachtu Xvim. His divinity restored, Bane appointed the High Priest Fzoul Chembryl, leader of the Zhentarim, as his Chosen. In the North, the Treaty of Garumn's Gorge officially recognizes the Kingdom of Many-Arrows: the first true Orc kingdom in ages, and a great threat to the newly born confederation of the Silver Marches.

With the kingdom weakened by Nalavarauthatoryl's failed invasion, an unexpected Shadovar threat rising in nearby Anauroch, and an infant on the throne, Cormyr's destiny in these troubled times was uncertain.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_OBOULD;Obould Many-Arrows;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_30550;Obould was the king of the orcs of the Citadel of Many Arrows in 1367 DR. He lost this city when an orc horde led by King Greneire attacked the Citadel in the summer of that year.

Obould retreated to Dark Arrow Keep, amassed a new army, and finally put his plans into action. Through sheer military acumen, he realized his goal of uniting most of the orc tribes in the Spine of the World.

BM_AFTER_THE_RAGE;After the Rage;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_AFTER_THE_RAGE_DESC;The Year of Rogue Dragons saw the great madness known as the Rage of Dragons overwhelm many of Faerûn's dragons. By the time it was over, older dragons had established new power structures, and younger ones had come to fresh prominence. And many, dragons and non-dragons alike, expressed new interest in draconic paths of belief - both the Draconic faith, and the sinister Cult of the Dragon. With the death of its founder Sammaster at the end of the preceding year, the Cult is seeking new ways to spread the power of undead dragons...;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_FAERUN_BTS;Before the Storm;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FAERUN_BTS_DESC;In the Year of the Prince, the inhabitants of the Realms had no idea of the turmoil that was about to come in the following years.

And, in the far east, the thundering of hooves are heard upon the steppes, heading west...;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_7048;Mourngrym Amcathra was a noble from Waterdeep, leaving his life of luxury early in his adulthood to become an adventurer and a Harper.

BM_FAERUN_SPELLSCAR;Spellscarred World;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FAERUN_SPELLSCAR_DESC;Though it has been almost a century since the Spellplague ravaged the entire world, and beyond, the Realms still feel the after-effects of this cataclysm. The death of Mystra at the hands of Cyric not only sent all of the Weave into chaos, but also briefly merged together the twin worlds of Abeir and Toril, displacing various realms of each into the other. Now the world is finally recovering, though blue flame still ravages large swathes of the planet.;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_GAUWERVYNDHAL;Gauwervyndhal;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_69111;Gauwervyndhal the Empress Dragon was the ruler of the Laerakond empire of Skelkor.

BM_TYRANNY_OF_DRAGONS;Tyranny of Dragons;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_TYRANNY_OF_DRAGONS_DESC;In the 1480s, the Cult of the Dragon was taken over by a faction that revered Tiamat, rather than maintaining the Cult's traditional focus on dracoliches. This faction strove to establish the supremacy of the Dragon Queen over the whole of Toril. But many dragons, and even some cult members, did not believe in this radical vision, and joined those who opposed it.;;;;;;;;;;;x 
ERA_CHAR_NAME_SEVERIN;Severin Silrajin;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_42269;Wyrmspeaker Severin Silrajin was the driving force behind the dramatic changes in the Cult of the Dragon during the 1480s.

BM_FAERUN_TORIL_HEALED;Toril Restored;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FAERUN_TORIL_HEALED_DESC;At the ending years of the tumultuous 15th century, the Realms underwent what would be called the Second Sundering, when Chosen walked the lands and long-dead gods came back to life. Much of the damage of the dreaded Spellplague was also undone, and the world breathes a sigh of relief. It came at a cost, however, as gods are now more distant when it comes to mortal matters, and evils old and new prepare to make their move before the world truly stabilizes.;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_15122;Dagult Nevermeber was the supposed descendant of Lord Nasher Alagondar through a bastard, and was once the Open Lord of Waterdeep before being expelled to Neverwinter.

ERA_CHAR_INFO_1011;After the people of Unther were displaced into the world of Abeir, they faced much adversity and were even enslaved by the Shyran genasi. The desperation of the Untheric people led to the resurgence of a new incarnation of Gilgeam, this time calling himself the Son of Victory. In the course of his war against the genasi, Gilgeam made a pact with the archdemon Graz'zt to bolster his forces, but just as he was about to win the war, he and his people were returned to Unther. There, he found the dragonborn of Tymanther occupying the lands of his people, and he immediately declared war on them. That war, however, devolved into a stalemate after the interference of both Asmodeus and Gilgeam's father, Enlil.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_NSI;Ras Nsi;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_52803;Ras Nsi was once one of the Barae, the Chosen of the primordial Ubtao.

He also underwent terrible rituals that transformed him from human into a yuan-ti malison, and allied himself with the lich Acererak to achieve his goals of dominating Chult.;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_HONOR_AMONG_THIEVES_DESC;Dagult Neverember lies in a mysterious coma. In his place, the charismatic Forge Fitzwilliam has swept to power as Lord of Neverwinter.
