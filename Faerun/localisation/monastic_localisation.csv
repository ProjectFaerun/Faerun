monastic_order_sun_soul;Order of the Sun Soul;;;;;;;;;;;x
monastic_order_sun_soul_desc;The Sun Soul monks follow a monastic tradition that they believe has its roots in the ancient empire of Netheril. In their philosophy, living things harbor a fragment of the sun's mystic essence within them. Just as the body has a shadow, so too does the spirit have a light. To get in touch with their internal light, Sun Soul monks follow a strict code of ascetic conduct called the Precepts of Incandescence: to seek physical perfection, to seek spiritual virtue, to shine light into darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;x

#
EVTDESC_4405_KIND;Sometimes, I get this nice, pleasant, irrational feeling when I see other people happy. I know I shouldn't let it get to me...it's just a weak, pathetic natural instinct, ill suited to a merciless killer such as myself. Maybe I could be a little kinder to those close to me, in secret...to satisfy the urge?;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4405_KIND;No one needs to know.;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_4405_KIND;This is how they get to you. No mercy.;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4406_KIND;It worked. A little bit of kindness to those most close to me, and I could just go back to ignore everyone else. As I should.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4406_KIND;Finally.;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4407_KIND;This is just embarassing. One act of kindness led to another, and I find myself giggling and smiling like an idiot. This is not who I am!;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4407_KIND;Shameful.;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4408_KIND;Those irrational feelings of kindness are finally gone, and my heart is as stony and cold as it's supposed to be. I'll never let my emotions take control of me ever again.;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4408_KIND;Power is the only thing that matters.;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4409_KIND;This isn't good...today, the young daughter of a farmer I recently executed for tax evasion came to court. Her genuine desperation moved me deeply, and I couldn't hold back tears...right in front of all my courtiers.;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4409_KIND;It's just so sad!;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTDESC_4405_ARBITRARY;When those I believe to be guilty somehow manage to escape punishment, I get angry. I know that true justice requires solid proof, but it would so much easier to forge a little bit of evidence here and there...at least when the culprit obviously deserves it!;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4405_ARBITRARY;Yes. The truly despicable deserve no quarter.;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_4405_ARBITRARY;No! The legal system is fair, and it works.;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4406_ARBITRARY;With just the slightest bit of manipulation and fabrication, no criminal can escape a guilty verdict. When backed into a corner, they all end up confessing, anyway, so I know I'm right!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4406_ARBITRARY;That was wise of me.;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4407_ARBITRARY;This is so horrible. When my fabricated evidence was effortlessly countered by an ironclad alibi, I felt so ashamed of myself...;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4407_ARBITRARY;How could I be so wrong?;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4408_ARBITRARY;Oh Lady Justice, how could I ever doubt you? Proving a culprit's guilt with a fair trial, without cheating, is so satisfying!;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4408_ARBITRARY;I AM the law!;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4409_ARBITRARY;Laws are worthless, aren't they? As another criminal triumphally strides out of our courtroom, I am left to wonder that perhaps there is no justice in this world.;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_4409_ARBITRARY;I'll take justice into my own hands.;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_4400_ADD_CRUEL;My wish to become a superior being has led me to the [Root.Society.GetName]. Training under the merciless masters of the order, I have realized that true strength, true power can only be reached by resisting and mastering true pain. Inflicting pain on others is the only way to test their worth.;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_4400_ADD_AMBITIOUS;My wish to become superior being has led me to the [Root.Society.GetName]. From now on, I will strive to best, the greatest – I live to surpass anyone who has ever existed.;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_4400_ADD_JUST;My wish to become a superior being has led me to the [Root.Society.GetName]. Training under the enlightened masters of the order, I have realized how truly important the philosophical concept of Law is to the entire multiverse. Order must be maintained, everywhere.;;;;;;;;x
