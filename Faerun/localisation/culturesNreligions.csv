asmodeusdealdesc_decision_desc;Offer your soul and lineage in exchange for a mighty boon.;;;;;;;;;;;x
asmodeusdealdesc.1;You have achieved much, but it still isn't enough. The prospect of an Infernal contract is ever tempting, and unlike most you have made it far in the cult with the skills and experience to back it up. Perhaps it is time to leverage your experience in dealing with devils...;;;;;;;;;;;x
asmodeusdealdesc.2;Beauty. Intelligence. Strength.\nAll three are desirable beyond measure, but signing a contract on firmer, limited terms will be more secure against fine print traps.;;;;;;;;;;;x
asmodeusdealdesc.3;Wishing for the world's gold would be a foolish act even for the gods themselves. I should settle on a contract with firmer, limited terms to secure myself against fine print traps.;;;;;;;;;;;x
asmodeusdealdesc.4;Even the gods don't work alone. With Infernal backing, I can secure my position in the world against the vagaries of fate. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
asmodeusdealdesc.8;The pilferage of the realm taxes must be organized for it to be this widespread. Despite the singing of your accursed blood all but confirming the culprit, you conduct investigation after futile investigation in denial.;;;;;;;;;;;x
asmodeusdealdesc.9;You have gotten used to suppressing the vile impulses of your blood, but inevitably you slip.\n When you do, it's usually the people around you that suffer. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
asmodeusdealdesc.10;Sacrifice is as common as it is sudden in the Nine Hells. Nevertheless, losing a child isn't something you get used to, not even as someone as accursed as yourself. The overpowering stench of brimstone offers no other explanation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
asmodeusdealdesc.11;The persistent rumours surrounding your Infernal heritage have made their rounds amongst yout troops.\nDesertions are increasing and you can scarcely wrest the bare minimum out of the merchants that supply your baggage trains out of fear. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
asmodeusdealdesc.12;It is not uncommon for you to be wracked by nightmares so vivid they cause you to be awoken by the pain the shades inflict.\nActual wounds are less common, much less the infected, weeping gashes across your arms.;;;;;;;;;;;x
asmodeusdealdesc.13;A pall of misfortune has descended on the realm. The people are laying them blame at your feet solely based on hysterical rumours, and it seems there is not much you can do besides prepare for the worst. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
asmodeusdealdesc.15;Vassal-Liege relationships can be strained at the best of times. Unfortunately, your latest Infernal outburst has strained things both in the metaphorical and the physical sense.;;;;;;;;;;;x
asmodeusdealdesc.17;Your very presence seems to have deleterious effects on your troops, sapping their vigour and spirit. However, physcially keeping a distance from your troops proves to be equally deleterious on their morale.;;;;;;;;;;;x
asmodeusdealdesc.18;As it turns out, the contract binds not only you, but your lineage as well. In addition, contractees who fail to serve the Cult of Asmodeus will suffer debilitating "restitutive" action by the forces of the Nine Hells.;;;;;;;;;;;x
